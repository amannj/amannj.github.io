First, price changes are infrequent in the core sectors. On average, 12% of consumer prices change each month, falling to 8.5% when sales prices are excluded. The frequency of producer price adjustment is greater (25%), reflecting that the prices of intermediate goods and energy are more flexible. For both consumer and producer prices, cross-sectoral heterogeneity is more pronounced than cross-country heterogeneity. Second, price changes tend to be large and heterogeneous. For consumer prices, the typical absolute price change is about 10%, and the distribution of price changes shows a broad dispersion. For producer prices, the typical absolute price change is smaller, but nevertheless larger than inflation. Third, price setting is mildly state-dependent: the probability of price adjustment rises with the size of price misalignment, mainly reflecting idiosyncratic shocks, but it does not increase very sharply. Fourth, for both consumer and producer prices, the repricing rate showed no trend in the period 2005-19 but was more volatile in the short run. Fifth, small cyclical variations in frequency did not contribute much to fluctuations in aggregate inflation, which instead mainly reflected shifts in the average size of price changes. Consistent with idiosyncratic shocks as the main driver of price changes, aggregate disturbances affected inflation by shifting the relative number of firms increasing or decreasing their prices, rather than the size of price increases and decreases.\n","date":1702944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702944000,"objectID":"05c097bd7ff510fcaf1eb83f8578cb3f","permalink":"https://amannj.github.io/working-papers/price-adjustment-euro-area/","publishdate":"2023-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working-papers/price-adjustment-euro-area/","section":"working-papers","summary":"This paper documents five stylised facts relating to price adjustment in the euro area, using various micro price datasets collected in a period with relatively low and stable inflation.","tags":["Working papers","Consumer prices","Price stickiness","Producer prices","Scanner data"],"title":"Price Adjustment in the Euro Area in the Low-Inflation Period: Evidence from Consumer and Producer Micro Price Data","type":"working-papers"},{"authors":["Juergen AMANN","Arti GROVER"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract This paper analyzes the impact of changes in energy prices on the competitiveness of manufacturing firms in Chile.

Many international organisations are now fully involved in implementing technical cooperation projects to reduce the use of materials for industrial output. However, while there is a wide consensus that the prevailing production paradigm cannot sustain the current industrial practices indefinitely, the policy space for the promotion of the Circular Economy is hampered by the lack of a complete understanding of winners and losers in international or omestic value chains and the overall net benefits of the undertaken measures. This paper develops the NICE (National Impacts of Circular Economy) tool, which is based on the Eora input-output data to analyse how technical cooperation projects, which are aimed at more sustainable use of materials, affect economic and social indicators. Whereas the long-term transition towards a circular economy and a more efficient economic system is less controversial, the results of this study help deepen the understanding of the possible short-term impacts, especially for countries struggling to climb the ladder of development.

This can be particularly useful if you want to re-run a particular programme at a prescribed time, for example, for a web scraper.\nFor the purpose of this post I will further assume that you have Python set up and running on your machine. For everything else, please follow the step-by-step guide below:\nStep 1: Create your Python script. This should be self-explanatory. Let’s assume we want to run the following script called my.py, which does nothing but print today’s date:\n#################### # Content of my.py # #################### import datetime # Get date and time todaysDate = datetime.datetime.today(); # Change display format (optional) todaysDate = todaysDate.strftime(\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\u0026#34;) # Print print(todaysDate) Now save your script! In my case, I’ll simply save the Python script on my Desktop.\nC:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop where \u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt; should be replaced with your Windows username.\nStep 2: Create Batch File to Run the Python Script First, open Notepad and generate the following generic structure:\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to python.exe\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to my.py\u0026gt;\u0026#34; pause In our example, the batch file will read as follows:\n\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\\my.py\u0026#34; pause Note: In case you want your batch file to run Git to automatically add, commit and push to GitHub, you will need a couple of extra lines of code which I discuss in this blog post.\nNext, save the file with the ‘bat’ file extension; we’ll call our file run_mypy.bat for now.\nFinally, go ahead and check if the batch file triggers your Python script correctly. For this, you only have to double-click run_mypy.bat. If everything has worked out, a command prompt should open now containing the following pieces of information (including the date and daytime, which in this case is 2020-12-16 12:12:12):\nC:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\u0026gt;\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\\my.py\u0026#34; 2020-12-16 12:12:12 C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\u0026gt;pause Press any key to continue . . . Step 3: Schedule Python Script using Windows Scheduler Open Control Panel and search for Administrative Tools.\nSelect Task Scheduler. There, select option Create Basic Task... in the right panel.\nGive your Task a name (in this case we’ll name the task ‘Run mypy’), and now define how often and when you want the task to be triggered. This step is rather self-explanatory.\nOnce you have configured the trigger for your job to your satisfaction, click next and define the Action which you want the scheduled task to perform. In our case we want to Start a program.\nClick Next and then on Browse. Then navigate to where your batch file sits. In our case C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\\run_mypy.bat.\nIMPORTANT: If you are planning on saving/appending data that you obtain from running the Python script, make sure you also provide the location of your application folder in Start in (optional). This allows the Scheduler to access all of the relevant elements (files, folders etc.) of your project. In our case, this would be C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\\.\nClick Next again and the final screen will provide a summary of the new task you have just created. You can always navigate back and change its configuration. Once you’re happy with your result click Finish and you’re done!\nTo check if the task you created works, access the Task Scheduler Library (left panel in Task Scheduler), select the task from the list of created tasks (middle panel), right-click and then click on Run. A terminal window should open and return the same result as when double-clicking run_mypy.bat.\nThis last step completes this tutorial. If you want to learn more about Windows Task Scheduler, check out the online documentation.\n","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"2b4299d60879a19338381848e4c85a13","permalink":"https://amannj.github.io/post/windows-scheduler/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/windows-scheduler/","section":"post","summary":"Working with Windows Scheduler on Windows 10 \u0026 11.","tags":["Tutorial - Windows - Git - Windows Scheduler"],"title":"How To Schedule Python Scripts to Automate Tasks using Windows Scheduler on Windows 10 \u0026 11","type":"post"},{"authors":["Juergen AMANN"],"categories":["Tutorial"],"content":"Let’s say you want to use a Windows bat file to automatically run Git to add, commit and push to GitHub.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will assume that we want to automatise the Python script for which we created a Windows Scheduler task in this blog post. Even though the content of this particular Python script does not merit such a configuration, in a more realistic scenario, it could, say, contain a web scrapper which, you might want to run at regular intervals, and push the obtained data to GitHub automatically.\nIn this post we will assume that you have a fully functional set-up with Git installed on your computer, and you also have linked your local project to your GitHub account, e.g., by cloning it. Furthermore, we assume you have followed this blog post up until Step 2 and want the bat file you just created to automatically run Git to add, commit and push to Github. This can be done in a few lines of code as demonstrated below.\nAdding Git Commands to Your Bat File For this purpose, we change the generic structure of the batch file to run our Python script in Step 2 of the aforementioned blog post from this\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to python.exe\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to my.py\u0026gt;\u0026#34; to this:\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to python.exe\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to my.py\u0026gt;\u0026#34; git add . git commit -m \u0026#39;scheduled commit\u0026#39; git push Note, however, that the above will not work in some cases, for example, if there are no changes made to the repository. In such a case you can instead use\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to python.exe\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Path to my.py\u0026gt;\u0026#34; git add --all git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit -m \u0026#34;scheduled commit\u0026#34; git push where\ngit add --all will add all unstaged files of the entire working tree; the next line will then make a commit (git commit -m \u0026#34;scheduled commit\u0026#34;) only if Git observes a change, i.e. differences, vis-a-vis the HEAD version git diff-index --quiet HEAD: In case git diff has exit code zero, git commit will be executed. A final word of caution: In case Git is not in your path, you will have to replace git with \u0026#34;C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\u0026#34; in the code chunks above.\nA more complete example In the case of the Windows Scheduler task discussed in this blog post where Git is not in our path, we would end up with the chunk below, where we also added timeout /t 5 to sleep in the batch file anywhere between 4 and 5 seconds before commiting and pushing to GitHub:\n\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;\\Desktop\\my.py\u0026#34; timeout /t 5 \u0026#34;C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\u0026#34; add --all \u0026#34;C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\u0026#34; diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit -m \u0026#34;scheduled commit\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\u0026#34; push Next steps Now that you have updated your bat file according to your needs, you can continue with Step 2 from this blog post to use Windows Scheduler to time its automatic execution.\n","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"7170b121c307277ade664628d52e41bf","permalink":"https://amannj.github.io/post/automatise-workflow/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/automatise-workflow/","section":"post","summary":"Making your life easier by automatising your workflow.","tags":["Tutorial","Windows","Git","Windows Scheduler"],"title":"How To Use a Windows Bat File to Schedule, Git Add, Commit and Push to GitHub","type":"post"},{"authors":["Juergen AMANN","Roman STOELLINGER"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"ad18b12649227a011ac494aa26d9e03f","permalink":"https://amannj.github.io/publication/achieving-sustainable-development/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/achieving-sustainable-development/","section":"publication","summary":"New empirical evidence on the impact of industrialization on social and environmental sustainability goals.
