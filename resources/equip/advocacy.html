<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Advocacy</h1>
<p>In many countries there are great expectations regarding the potential of the lastest wave of the digital technolgy evolution (also referred to as industry 4.0 throughout this tool) and its effect on the economy. International organisations such as the World Bank, the OECD as well as UNIDO have devoted large part of their ressources to provide a better understanding on how these new technologies may reshape our economies; see Box X for more information.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this EQuIP module, we take a close look at the <strong>effect of industry 4.0 and the adoption of new technologies on the manufacturing sector</strong>. While this of course only allows us to cover parts of the effect the adoption of new, digital technologies, we provide a very clear and granular focus on the <strong>manufacturing industries and developing countries</strong> in particular. While this differentiates our efforts from other studies on this topic, we want to point out that the analysis conducted in this tool should be seen as a complementing rather than a holitic analysis on new technologies.</p>
<div class="rmdcomment">

</div>
<p>When considering the effect of technological revolutions on manufacturing processes, it is important to understand that technological evolution is hardly a one-way street. Rather
is is an important and interconnected part of a modern economy. Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a> illustrates this point: New technologies (such as industry 4.0) will only really be adopted into the production processes of an economy, if there is something to be gained from it. These potential gains could be manyfold<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but typically always also effect the efficiency of a production process: If new technologies are allowing a company to produce more output with the same amount of input, they are eager to adopt this technology. If these technologies are adopted by many/all firms of country, their productivity gains reach macro-economic dimensions, and macro-prudential indicators will reflect the changes in the production dynamics which are the result of the newly adopted technology.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig1"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, new technology is rarely something that falls from the heavens. It is well understood that research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures are a great indicator of the success of a company: If a company tries to research how new technologies may improve their own production processes, this will not only set the company appart from less R&amp;D-engaged competitors but also result in the creation of new technology as a whole. In this sense, the pursuit of productivity growth also leads to the development of new technologies. It should become clear from this, that dimensions of ‘adoption of new technologies’ and ‘productivity’ are two sides of the same coin and should always be considered together.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the connection between the adoption of new technologies and productivity growth is a very complex question. As illustrated in Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a>, what glues these two domains together are the right <strong>capabilities and preconditions</strong> that are needed to allow for a successful communication of both domains. Because of the importance of this insight, a complete EQuIP tool (Tool 9: Industrial capability indicators) is dedicated to shed light on all the relevant dimensions that are needed to provide the right starting conditions for robust economic growth within - but not exclusive to - manufacturing.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section we move on to provide a clear conceptual framework on <strong>what is meant by industry 4.0</strong> and how it is integrated with digital manufacturing technologies with particular focus on developing countries. We then move on to discuss a way to measure and identify different kinds of productivity growth dynamics.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Adoption of new technologies in manufacturing</h3>
<p>Within the policy debate, many countries are orienting their industrial strategies and policies towards the adoption of technologies associated with the fourth wave of industrial innovation in the hopes that these new technologies can boost economic performance through increased productivity and by opening new markets.</p>
<p>The focus of this tool is in the intersection of the latest technology emerging in the digital and production technology and manufacturing production process. We refer to this domain as the <strong>smart factory</strong> which is populated by a very particular set of production technologies and concepts; see Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a> for more information.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig2"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>At the same time it is important to recognise that digital technologies have had a long and successful past within the domain of manufacturing already and are not limited to the latest wave of digital technology.This is important to note: Industry 4.0 refers to some particular types of digital technology but not to all digital technology. This point is illustrated in Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> and shows a progression von analog production towards smart, digital technologies: Starting from analog production, processes have become more integrated while also having moved from partial use of digital and ICT technologies.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>What is particularly important here is that Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> also allows us to identify a particular set of very narrowly defined concepts which can be related to (a) particular stage(s) of the digital technology pyramid. For example the domain of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing is most closely related to the smart factory stage. This is because for the large-scale production of goods through 3D printing, very specific and newly developed materials are required which belong to the technological frontier ( Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a>). CAD-CAM technologies<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> on the other hand allow for a large-scale of computer aided production process within manufacturing but a fully integrated logistical or digital network across areas is not required. Lastly, robots govern by fare the broadest domain of digital technologies. This is true as (simple) robots can be used to fulfill very rudamentry tasks with little to no complexity in rigid production process; however (smart) robots also form a central building block for smart factories. It is because of this complexity that we will pay very close attention to the adoption of robots and robot technology in one of the later parts of this tool.</p>

<p>
Questions for Nico: Should we add an info box pointing at all the categories as defined in the IDR questionaire? Should we follow up on Alejandro’s suggestion on how to change this figure? Should we provide a narrow definition of what we mean by the the industry 4.0 goods clusters? particularly robots?
</p>
</div>
<p>While these three goods clusters allow us to identify very specific dimension in the adoption of industry 4.0 ready manufacturing technologies, they themselves are part of a much broader group of capital goods; see Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a>. This is an important insight as capital goods are of high relevance for a positive development path of the manufacturing industry <strong>CITATION/REFERENCE needed</strong>. Therefore, considering the three dimensions in Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a> jointly, we can empirically evaluate the intensity with which countries govern a particular domain of capital goods</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Productivity</h2>
<p>Productivity is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country.
The growth rate of productivity can be approximated by the growth rate of value added generation minus the growth rate of employment as illustrated in the formula below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
growth(Labour~Productivity) = growth(Value~added) - growth(Employment)
\]</span></p>
<p>In simple terms, we will see an increase in productivity (a positive growth rate) if the same number of workers (employment growth of zero) generates more value added, e.g. by producing more goods, (a positive value added growth rate). Conversely, if one requires more employees to produce the same amount of value added, then the measured degree of productivity would have gone down (negative growth).</p>

<hr />
<p>As Chapter <a href="advocacy.html#advocacy">2</a> has discussed, the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies poses many challenges and difficulties and is by no means easy. Successful adoption depends many different aspects with capabilities and pre-conditions being among the most important ones. While <em>EQuIP Tool 9</em> discuss means of how to evaluate these sets of pre-requirement, in this section we will take a closer look at the consequences of medium- to long-run technology adoption. As discussed before, the relationship between technologcal development and productivity growth is circular as, on the one hand, the objective of improving production processes may generate new technologies. At the same time, new technological developments may also find their way into production processes if they allow for a more efficient and productive production process.</p>
<p>Successful adoption of these technologies will eventually be reflected by changes in macro-economic variables such as value added and employment and is this set of macro-economic variables policy-makers are interested in. Rarely people would care about the adoption of a particular new invention into an economy unless it would provide prospects of a prosperous future, most importantly through an <em>increase in productivity of the production process</em>. We have also seen in Chapter <a href="advocacy.html#advocacy">2</a> that industry 4.0 technology can and should not be considered as a completely new and unprecedented form of technological revolution (even though it does bring a set of novel advances with it as well). As a consequence of that, it makes sense to start the empirical analysis of the adoption of technology adoption by looking at the past and present, before keeping a somewhat more future-minded scope in the next chapter which deals with the adoption of industry 4.0 technology in greater detail.</p>
<p>One of the most important one is that of <strong>How is this new technology going to affect the performance of a particular industry?</strong>. There are many important macro-prudential question for policy makers when it comes to the adoption of new technologies. In turn, policy makers are also eager to adopt of new and promissing technologies (such as industry 4.0) to ‘jump on the bandwagon’ of the unfolding industrial revolution either in the hopes of boosting economic performance (productivity) or in the fear of otherwise falling behind in this inevitable process. At the same time, there is widespread fear that the adoption of new technologies may do very little to boost employment (‘jobless growth’).</p>
<hr />
<p>These simple fundamentals is visualised in Figure <a href="advocacy.html#fig:fig5">2.5</a>, which illustrates the complex nature of productivity growth dynamics an economy might face: Exemplarily, positive productivity growth can either be brought about by a positive and higher growth of value added over also positive employment growth (also referred to ‘inclusive and tenable growth’ or ‘runner industries’) as well as positive value added and negative employment growth to which we will also refer as ‘jobless growth’. Lastly, positive productivity growth may also be reported if value added growth reduces less than employment growth (‘declining growth’).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig5"></span>
<img src="images/figure_5.png" alt="Visualisation of concept." width="95%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.5: Visualisation of concept.
</p>
</div>
<p>From this it should become clear that not all forms of productivity growth are equally desirable; nor are all forms of a decline in productivity growth equally bad. This classification tool can help policy makers identify the nature of the structural dynamics of industrial sectors and assess as to whether they follow a more or less desirable regime. At the same time, the logical matrix allows to re-assess the classification of particular industries conditional on the time dimension considered: Exemplarily, industry 4.0 adoption in a particular industry might have led to an increase (or decrease) in the demand of employees which was not apparent in the pre-industry 4.0 era for that particular industry. By varying the time dimension of the analysis one can therefore identify and classify the changes of industry-specific dynamics after a set of policy interventions and/or market transformations.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is interesting an dimportant for policy makers to know how much of their economy follows a sustainalbe growth path in employment and productivity. We will capture this dimension through the analysis of <em>runner industry expossure</em>.</p>
<p>See Appendix <a href="#rujust"><strong>??</strong></a> , for a justification of the runner exposure analysis.</p>
<p>From the runner industry methodological part (section <strong>XXXX</strong>), we have seen that high income countries are those characterized by a high share of runners. This finding is crucial for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It shows that rich countries are those showing the highest share of sectors characterized by inclusive growth, meaning productivity, employment and manufacturing value added enhancing development. <em>Countries which became rich are the ones which were more exposed to an inclusive growth path.</em> This is a very important message: Growth does not necessarily need to pay a toll in terms of growth/employment trade-off.</p></li>
<li><p>Runner industries include low tech and medium high-tech industries alike. The fact that rich countries are those showing a higher share of runners means that in order to reach a high-income level, countries do not have to bet on medium high-tech industries alone. As mentioned earlier, there are many ways to the heaven and the message here seems to be that inclusive growth and within-industry structural change1 matters as well. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industry 4.0 debate as this latest wave of technological advancement will not create technologies that are exclusively confined to the domain of medium-high tech industry, but rather will also find their way into the lower tech segments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From a policy perspective, the analysis of the share of runners constitutes precious information for policy makers: First of all because the runner industry classification allows policy makers to identify jobless growth dynamics as part of the conceptual toolbox. If the uptake of industry 4.0 will be successful in a particular country (and more generally, if that country will be able to increase its production productivity either through capital deepening or other channels), a low share of runners flags a higher vulnerability to undesirable employment dynamics. In other words, this means that countries are more exposed to industries where inclusive and tenable growth was not achieved. Secondly, identification of such outcomes may call for a special attention of the policy maker potentially leading to an intervention with the aim to preserve inclusive and tenable growth by also considering the country specific characteristics developed in the next section. In this sense the runner industry classification may not only serve as an assessment but also as an early-warning tool in the context of a much wider policy intervention analysis.</p>
