<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Adoption of new technologies</h2>
<p>When it comes to the generation of new technologies, economies can either create these themselves or import them. It has been widely established in economic research that the latter is more common.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Consequently, it makes sense to investigate the trade dynamics between economies, i.e. import and export flows.
Different speeds and intensities of technology adoption across countries and over time can be highlighted this way.</p>
<p>However, it must be stressed that the mere adoption of new technologies through importation does not guarantee the local absorption and diffusion. For this to be a successful strategy, preconditions that create a growth-enabling environment of a country matter:<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The most recent Industrial Development Report <span class="citation">(UNIDO <a href="#ref-IDR2020">2020</a>)</span> also focuses on industry 4.0 with new firm level data. It stresses the necessity of certain pre-requisites in order for firms being able to successfully adopt new (digital) technology. They range from institutional and infrastructure capabilities such as energy supply and connectivity, to production and technological capabilities such as skilled staff that can handle machines and software, to changes in a firm’s culture such as the acceptance of more automation in the production process. Importing technology can additionally strengthen these capabilities as there are learning processes related to trade. These can come from cooperation with universities or foreign partners, or from reverse engineering, just to name a few.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the analysis of this tool a heterogeneous group of countries is considered. This group consists of a set of advanced economies (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea), all of which are big players in the adoption and generation of new technologies; see Appendix <a href="exporters.html#exporters">A</a>. The list of countries is complemented by a group of emerging economies (China, the Russian Federation as well as Viet Nam and Georgia). These countries have been selected with the purpose to illustrate particular development patterns observed in the adoption strategies of industry 4.0 technologies.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the previous discussion, industry 4.0 technologies are a sub-group of capital goods. Whereas the former identify cutting-edge technologies one is most likely to find in modern, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, capital goods cover a much broader domain. Capital goods are machinery and other manufactured goods which are used by industry, government and non-profit private institutions. They are in fact producers’ goods that are defined as part of fixed capital formation <span class="citation">(United Nations Trade Statistics <a href="#ref-UNBEC2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Capital goods form one of the central building blocks of a healthy and growing manufacturing sector: Economic research has demonstrated that manufacturing provides great potential for positive growth trajectories through its scalability and high degree of capital accumulation, both of which can be identified through the utilisation of capital goods. Consequently, the analysis begins on the level of the capital goods group which can be understood to represent both the latest as well as already more established production technologies. Then, the same tools are applied for the sub-group of industry 4.0 goods that allow to identify industry 4.0-specific dynamics.This is done with the goal to provide a simple tool for policy makers to analyse and categorise where their own economy stands relative to other economies and the global level, both in the utilisation of capital goods as well as industry 4.0 technology as part of the domestic production process. It will become clear that different income groups of countries (high income, upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income) show some distinct trade patterns when it comes to imports and exports of production technology.</p>
<div id="capital-goods" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Capital goods</h3>
<p>The first graph (Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:cap-goods">4.1</a>) shows shares of imports of capital goods in all goods (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:importcap-share">3.1</a>) between 2002 and 2017. Considering the whole time period, only the Russian Federation increased its import share significantly. What might be surprising, is that there is no clear division between high-income countries and the others. For example, Japan as well as Georgia had decreasing shares until the middle of the last decade when shares started to increase again.</p>
<p>On the one hand, decreasing import shares can mean that relatively fewer capital goods are imported because a country is able to produce them domestically. On the other hand, increasing import shares can show that a country is increasingly able to use goods that are related to some technology.</p>

<p>While imports can highlight users of production technologies, exports show producers (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:exportcap-share">3.2</a>).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.2: Share of capital goods exports in total exports
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:cap-goods-exp">4.2</a> makes clear that there are countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany or China where capital goods make up one third of their total exports, while others such as the Russian Federation or Georgia decreased their shares of capital goods in exports. Viet Nam seems to have transformed into an exporter in the last ten to fifteen years. Since the numbers represent production technology of all vintages, we cannot yet see who the technology leaders are in terms of new technological advancements. This will be done by inspecting imports and exports of 4.0 goods below.</p>
<p>An immediate question arising from this initial analysis is how policy makers can obtain a benchmark relating country performance patterns to global dynamics. We propose two indicators to facilitate this requirement: By calculating the import shares relative to the world average (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCAcap-import">3.3</a>), one can quantify the import performance of a country in relation to the global average. This relation is called ‘revealed comparative advantage’ (RCA). If a country is characterized by an import RCA larger than one, this means that it imports more than the world average. In turn, this could point to a faster adoption of technology for countries that are not yet at the technological frontier.
In that sense, the RCA of imports (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCAcap-import">3.3</a>) is strongly connected to the adoption rate (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:importcap-share">3.1</a>) as both indicators depend on the share of capital goods in total imports. The same overall import profiles will show across countries with both indicators but the interpretation changes as RCA is a relative measure.</p>
<p>As the second indicator, RCA exports (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCAcap-export">3.4</a>), serves as a key measure to detect the local capabilities of countries in producing capital goods. As before, if a country is characterized by an RCA (export) larger than 1, it exports more than the global average. This means that it has acquired capabilities to export sophisticated and technology-intensive goods and is competitive on the global stage.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:RCAcap"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.3: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of capital goods
</p>
</div>
<p>An interesting picture emerges from the figure above. Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:RCAcap">4.3</a> displays if countries import or export more or less than the world average. When this information is combined, a story about technology adoption that is based on ‘revealed’ trade flows can be told.</p>
<p>Let us look at examples to make this clear: The Russian Federation is the only country in our sample that clearly imports more capital goods over time than the world average (upper graph); while it also exports much less than the world average (lower graph). This points to the fact that the Russian Federation uses capital goods and technologies that come with them in their production process but they are not above-average exporters.
This is either because (i) they have not yet adopted and absorbed the technology to an extent that allows them to become exporters of capital goods or (ii) they produce only for the domestic market or (iii) they use the production technology to produce and export other (non-capital) goods.</p>
<p>Similar to the Russian Federation, Georgia shows low export exposure compared to the world average. However, they also do not import significantly more capital goods than the world average. This most likely points to the fact that Georgia is not yet able to adopt all the technologies that are associated with capital goods. The rest of the countries show a relatively similar evolution. Over time, they import less capital goods than the world average. While China decreased its share continuously, the others are relatively stable across the years. At the same time, they export more than the world average. This implies that these countries have to produce capital goods themselves. This is another indicator of successful technology adoption, in the sense that they no longer need to import production technology but have become producers.</p>
<p>On the basis of the indicators shown we can create a classification of the following sort.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>RCA import</th>
<th>RCA export</th>
<th>Group</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>&lt; 1</td>
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>specialized producer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>specialized producer and user</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>&gt; 1</td>

<tr class="even">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here, ‘specialized producer’ indicates a country with an import RCA of below (or close to) one and an export RCA greater than one. These countries have a revealed comparative advantage in exporting goods (but not in importing) and are typically the ones closest to the technology frontier.</p>
<p>Next up are economies which are ‘specialized producers and users’ which have a comparative advantage in both importing and in exporting. Here it is important to emphasise that, despite the fact that they have an import and export RCA greater than one, most likely they do not import the same set of goods as they export. This means that if such a country is identified for, say, capital goods, it makes sense to ‘dig deeper’ and look at what kind of capital goods the country imports and exports. Most likely this is where some differences can be identified: A country may be a strong exporter for some groups of goods, while it may still be an importer when it comes to the adoption of the latest available technology. We can see this through the analysis of RCAs of industry 4.0 goods below. China is an example that, in the beginning of the period, showed a pattern as described but continuously decreased its share in capital goods imports. The third group, which consists of ‘specialized users’, are countries with an import RCA bigger than one and an export RCA smaller than one. These are the countries that typically try to adopt new technology through imports and absorption. The Russian Federation is an example in our sample. Lastly, with both RCAs below one, these countries are non-specialized, at least not yet.</p>
<p>This classification of countries based on trade flows of capital goods can help policy makers, first, to evaluate if they are users or producers of production technology. Second, it can act as a benchmarking exercise in technology adoption because the classification is very much related to income groups defined by the <span class="citation">World Bank (<a href="#ref-WB2019">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:progress-one">4.4</a> illustrates very clearly that, on average, there is a considerable spread for the export RCAs of capital goods: High income countries have on average the highest export RCAs, followed by upper middle, lower middle and finally low income countries. As for import RCAs, we can observe that, on average, the import propensity seems to first build up as economies grow richer but decline after a country has reached the lower middle income mark. It has to be noted, however, that for all four income group aggregates, the differences are both relatively small in terms of magnitude and also well centred around the global average mark of ‘1’.</p>

<p>For capital goods, which represent all forms of production technology, this means that the higher the income of a country, the more likely it is to be an exporter of these goods. Overall, only a relatively small fraction of countries are specialized exporters but around half of countries are specialized importers and thus users of capital goods.

<strong>Disclaimer to classification</strong>
</p>
<p>
Please note that this analysis provides a simplified means to analyse an otherwise very complex topic and any obtained classification of a particular country and year should always be considered with a grain of salt: Good knowledge of the country’s particular situation as well as the time profile of the RCAs is recommended. This is because of the following reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
‘Revealed’ trade patterns are used to infer adoption rates from that. Some countries, such as the United States have a large domestic market. Their share of exports of high-technology goods in their total exports might be relatively small, although the U.S. can clearly be considered a technology leader.
</li>
<li>
The cut-off at ‘1’ tells a clear story in that it represents the world average of import or export shares; however, some countries might be very close to that cut-off, being above it and then below it in the next year. Especially small product groups might show high volatility (fluctuations) in the numbers resulting possibly in a misleading story.
</li>
<li>
To get a complete picture, always look at the whole time series of your country of interest and also take other country specific information, you might have, into account. In our example, China and Viet Nam changed the group over the years which is an important information about their development.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What is more, the exercise of calculating RCAs could alternatively be done with imports and exports as shares of nominal gross domestic product. This variant leads to very similar results as the one presented above. Also, using ‘1’ as the relevant cut-off to define the classification could be replaced by using the average of all country RCAs in imports and exports respectively. <strong>We propose to use ‘1’ as cut-off as it is simpler and does not change the main insights discussed above qualitatively when using the averages instead.</strong>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies</h3>
<p>While the numbers above concerned all capital goods, the focus now switches to 4.0 goods, goods related to additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM or robotics which are part of the ‘smart factory’. With the same method as above, it can be found out which countries are users and producers of goods related to the latest technological production processes.
The following graph (Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:imp-shares">4.5</a>) shows the share of imports of 4.0 goods in total imports in percent (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:import-share">3.5</a>). First, the numbers for some of the countries in the sub-sample are remarkably stable over time and they are still relatively low in absolute terms, as the smart factory is a relatively new phenomenon. We know from other research (see e.g., <span class="citation">UNIDO (<a href="#ref-IDR2020">2020</a>)</span> or <span class="citation">Gal et al. (<a href="#ref-galOECD2019">2019</a>)</span>) that it is a small number of mostly highly productive firms that are the first that adopt new technologies generating a ‘digital capability gap’ within countries between the ‘best and the rest’.</p>
<p>During the first decade of the century, the Russian Federation, China and Viet Nam decreased their share of imports of 4.0 goods. Beginning in 2010, with the exception of China, the rest of the subset increased their relative imports, albeit very slowly. The Russian Federation reached their 2002 level again in 2017 with slightly less than 0.6 percent of imports being 4.0 goods. As with capital goods, import shares do not seem to be related to income levels at a first glance, at least not for our sub-sample of countries.</p>

</div>
<p>For exports of 4.0 goods (indicator <a href="methodology.html#tab:export-share">3.6</a>), there seems to be a correlation with income for our subset. Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea seem to be the largest exporters in terms of export shares.</p>
<p>Again, as a benchmark exercise and to interpret the shares, the following shows the revealed comparative advantage for 4.0 goods (indicators <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCA-import">3.7</a> and <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCA-export">3.8</a>). Numbers above one indicate imports or exports above the world average respectively.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.7: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of 4.0 goods
</p>
</div>
<p>The resulting figure allows to conclude that some countries do not yet import capital goods or 4.0 goods, while some others are importing industry 4.0 technology but have not yet moved into a leading position in these technologies which would allow them to also engage actively in exporting. Again, some others are on the way of adopting these technology, yet another group - here Japan - are technology leaders and main exporters of 4.0 goods. This analysis can be generalized to all countries and provides the following picture:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:progress-two"></span>
<img src="I40_Productivity_files/figure-html/progress-two-1.png" alt="RCA exports and imports for industry 4.0 goods by income group" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.8: RCA exports and imports for industry 4.0 goods by income group
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:progress-two">4.8</a> reveals, the differences across income groups seem much more pronounced. While lower income countries are more rarely engaged in industry 4.0 goods trading activities, the import RCA for upper middle income countries is by far the highest while their corresponding export RCA is only slightly higher than that of its lower income counterparts. In other words: Upper middle income countries are predominantly importing industry 4.0 technologies. High income countries on the other hand are much more balanced. It has to be noted however, that among the group of high income countries there exists a small and particularly export-led sub-group of countries (see <a href="exporters.html#exporters">A</a>) that are mainly responsible for driving up the average RCA export share of the high income countries. In that sense, the information provided in this section may be seen as evidence that the progression dynamics of industry 4.0 goods are currently unfolding within the group of high income countries while they have much more clearly emerged for capital goods and across all income groups already.</p>
<p>These first indicators provide the policy maker with an overview of a country and comparison with other countries on where they stand in terms of overall technology adoption and absorption by looking at trade patterns of capital goods as well as 4.0 goods.</p>
<p>While Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:progress-one">4.4</a> and <a href="analysis.html#fig:progress-two">4.8</a> provide some interesting insights on the evolution of classification patterns of the different income groups over time, one can furthermore derive some clear empirical evidence in favour of a technological progression that is reflected in changes of the import/export structure of capital and industry 4.0 goods as economies growth richer. An additional discussion on these fundamentals is offered in Appendix <a href="progressionpatterns.html#progressionpatterns">I</a></p>
</div>
<div id="ch:diff40" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Adoption dynamics within the industry 4.0 goods</h3>
<p>The analysis above showed that, for example, Japan shows a high export exposure in both groups of goods. In order to know if Japan’s success as an exporter is based on a single technology or is more evenly spread, we can distinguish between different goods. As discussed before, 4.0 goods can be differentiated as additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM and (other) Robotics. Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:impdiff">4.9</a> shows the share of imports (in percent) of total imports of a country.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:impdiff"></span>
<img src="I40_Productivity_files/figure-html/impdiff-1.png" alt="Import share (%) in total imports" width="864" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.9: Import share (%) in total imports
</p>
</div>
<p>The first observation is that import shares are very low across countries with a maximum of around 0.4 percent in 2017. This might not be surprising as these goods are among the newest generation of technological capital goods. However, countries in this sub-sample show an overall declining or stagnant share of imports in additive manufacturing or CAD-CAM. What is more, the relative position of countries did not change from the more aggregate goods above. This pattern changes, however, when one looks at Robotics where shares of imports of robots in total imports are increasing for the most part.</p>
<p>Additionally, to study RCA as above, the user can also asses the economic importance of these imports when compared to a country’s production. Figure <a href="analysis.html#fig:imp40diffGDP">4.10</a> presents imports in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This way one can show that, for example, Viet Nam imports much more 4.0 goods than the other countries in this sample, relative to their overall production. Relating imports to a country’s production can thus help give more context to import shares and indicate which goods or technologies are important numerically.</p>

</div>
<p>This section provided the policy maker with a set of indicators that have to be used in conjunction in order to understand technology adoption patterns. Import shares that indicate the importance of a (group of) good(s) and their potential to help in the process of technology adoption are combined with RCA of imports and exports to classify countries as being users or producers. Disaggregating the data can highlight if a country specializes in particular goods or technologies or if it lacks some of them completely. Additionally, the classification of countries together with their position in the worldwide income distribution can help policy makers in comparing their revealed comparative advantages to others. This can highlight potential strengths and weaknesses in the adoption process and points to areas of potential policy interventions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SUMMARY: How to use the concept</strong></p>
<p>It should be clear from the above that you need to combine all measures to get a complete picture of technology adoption with the help of trade data. To summarize:</p>
<p>-1 Look at import and export shares (indicators <a href="methodology.html#tab:importcap-share">3.1</a>, <a href="methodology.html#tab:exportcap-share">3.2</a>, <a href="methodology.html#tab:import-share">3.5</a> and <a href="methodology.html#tab:export-share">3.6</a>) of capital goods and 4.0 goods.</p>
<p>-2 Calculate revealed comparative advantage (RCA) for imports and exports of capital goods and 4.0 goods (indicators <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCAcap-import">3.3</a>, <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCAcap-export">3.4</a>, <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCA-import">3.7</a> and <a href="methodology.html#tab:RCA-export">3.8</a>).</p>
<p>-3 Plot the RCAs over time (together with those of comparator countries you are interested in).</p>
<p>-4 Interpret the findings by considering changes over time and also compare your country to the average of the same income group as a benchmark (compare Figures <a href="#progress-one"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#progress-two"><strong>??</strong></a> or similar in appendix <a href="#ch:progressionpatterns"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<p>-5 Do this analysis for more detailed products or product groups to see if the aggregate results are driven by specific goods in a particular country.</p>
