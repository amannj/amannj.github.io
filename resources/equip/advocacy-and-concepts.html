<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Industry 4.0: Distinctive in nature, yet part of a long history of technological change.</h3>
<p>The concept of industry 4.0 boosts the idea of breakthrough technologies which are rapidly penetrating the international market scenario. It is true that the business environment and the production process of the more recent times are rapidly changing and becoming increasingly fast-paced: Exemplarily, maintenance is now progressively governed by powerful algorithms which can predict when and where to replace materials in a firm’s production process and react instantaneously and accordingly. Similarly, humans are increasingly rather supervisors of production processes than manual executors of operations.</p>
<p>Despite its often times argued disruptive nature, there are good reasons to assume that industry 4.0 is itself part of a long history of waves of technological change. This is true as all the technologies associated with their respective revolutionary waves in the past were considered to be of a destructive nature: Beginning in the late 18th century with the advent of steam power and the invention of the power loom, the first industrial revolution ushered in mechanization and radically changed how goods were manufactured. In the late 19th century, electricity and assembly lines made mass production possible, giving rise to the second revolution. Many cite the third revolution as beginning in the 1970s, when advances in computing enabled pre-programmed machines and networks and thereby empowering automation.</p>
<p>The fourth industrial revolution is set out to take what was started during the third wave a step further, with the adoption of computers and automation enhanced by smart and autonomous systems which are fuelled by big data and complex artificial learning algorithms. Digitally connected manufacturing, often referred to as “industry 4.0”, encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from 3D printing to robotics, new materials, as well as biotechnology and smart production systems. The definition of industry 4.0 adopted in the present module is anchored in digitalization concepts and includes physical and digital technologies such as analytics, artificial intelligence, cognitive technologies and the internet of things (IoT) alike. This new wave of technological innovations, which is characterized by the integration of digital connectivity and advanced technologies, gives rise to automated industrial systems and smart production processes that boost efficiency across economic activities and will inevitably reshape the face of the manufacturing sector as we know it.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Beating the buzzer: The slow uptake of industry 4.0 technologies in developing countries despite its high policy relevance.</h3>
<p>Each industrial revolution marks a major turning point in the shift of technological, socio-economic and cultural conditions. Waves of technological change and paradigm shifts, driven by the surge of scientific discoveries, have followed one another in accelerated succession. Since then the developmental lag between pure science and engineering application has progressively shortened. Because accumulated technological and productive capabilities of countries differ, a ‘role model’ of successful adoption which would suite all countries does not exist; nor is there a one-size-fits-all policy solution in responding to challenges and opportunities (Lee and Malerba 2017; Dominguez Lacasa et al. 2019).
At the same time, the expectation of what the new wave of technological innovation could potentially bring to the table for the developing as well as developed world are at least twofold: For developed countries, industry 4.0 could be a way to regain manufacturing competitiveness. As for developing countries, industry 4.0 could provide the much-needed route to moving up the value chain, something that has become increasingly important to achieve in the face of rising labour costs. However, the creation and diffusion of newly emerging technologies remain extremely concentrated at the world level; though some emerging economies are timidly entering into the new technologies: For emerging technologies such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM), robotics or additive manufacturing, it is documented that less than 10 countries explain 85% of all triadic patents while 77% of all exports are directly associated with these technologies (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). At the same time, 84 countries remain excluded from the global creation and use of these technologies (Foster-McGregor, Nomaler &amp; Verspagen, 2019; Lavopa, 2019).
In a recent study, Santiago (2019) illustrates that most of the highly industrialized countries have paved their ways accelerating the economic transformation to embrace Industry 4.0. The author documents that at least 9 industrializing countries have announced national strategies around advanced manufacturing, a diversity of approaches, including industrial policies or science, technology and innovation plans, or standalone feasibility studies. Regarding developing countries, several middle-income economies, like the BRICS members, are already adopting smart manufacturing and are even entering areas traditionally reserved for highly industrialized countries (Daudt and Willcox 2016; López-Gómez et al. 2017). For instance, China is adopting industrial development strategies that seek to capitalize on new windows of opportunity where it can benefit from its increasing ability to produce new technologies: Its search for value addition and enhanced technological content is superseding traditional cost advantage strategies (Li 2017; The Economist 2015). Apart from large developing countries, only a handful of smaller counterparts have defined or are in the process of developing strategic policy agendas around smart manufacturing; something which is rarely observed for the group of the least developed economies.
For countries willing to adopt new technologies, a minimum base of industrial capabilities is required. Lavopa (2019) shows a clear positive relationship between the adoption roles across different countries; both in terms of innovators, producers as well as, more generally, when it comes to the utilization of technologies associated with the 4th industrial revolution and their average set of industrial capabilities. Similarly, Andreoni and Anzolin (2019) have identified five categories of challenges which explain the gap between developing and developed countries when it comes to their engagement with industry 4.0 technologies and encompass areas such as basic capabilities, retrofitting and integration, digital infrastructure, digital capability gap as well as access and affordability.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Learning through adoption: Imports as the key channel of industry 4.0 technology adoption.</h3>
<p>Adoption and diffusion of technology across the ecosystem are fundamental steps to capitalize on the window of opportunity of industry 4.0. The experiences of some of the most successful manufacturing firms in East Asia suggest that learning is not possible without adoption. There, most of these successful firms were documented to have started with the adoption of foreign technology for production first and then learned from using and finally enhanced further productivity by mastering these technologies (Lee, 2019). For instance, South Korea and Taiwan followed in the footsteps of an early industrialiser, Japan. Similar episodes of imitate-to-innovate have also fuelled the successful emulation of new production processes and products in China.</p>
<p>From latecomers to followers, benchmarking adoption is crucial. A key concern of today’s latecomers is whether they have invested enough resources at the national level as part of the adoption process of new technology in order to turn into a successful follower and, if not, how far they fall behind. An important insight from the historical experience is that latecomers do not necessarily have to become original inventors of new technologies themselves. Rather, taking small, well-informed steps to test technological and policy options according to the goals desired, has proved to be the preferred strategy before fully committing to the implementation of the policy tool at hand. Building on this rationale, the main entry point to a successful adoption of industry 4.0 technologies among developing countries could either be that of a fast-paced adoption process of the emerging technologies or a more adaptive response to the local circumstances through incremental, follow-on innovations with distinct twists. In either case, the import of industry 4.0 goods<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> can be an indicator of adoption of technological change for developing countries.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> The view ahead: What to expect from industry 4.0 in the medium and long run?</h3>
<p>Impacts of industry 4.0 on productivity and employment as a key concept in the debate. Any kind of innovation will only gain a foothold if it is beneficial for the firm to adopt the new technologies, i.e. if the newly available technologies result in an improvement of the production processes by making them more productive. These fundamentals are as true for any previously adopted technology as they are in the context of the most recent wave of technological advancements: When countries plan their strategies for industry 4.0, their expectation is an increase of productivity in the production process while ideally preserving if not by increasing jobs through the opening of new markets.</p>
<p>The traditional neoclassical growth accounting method has been the standard method in the literature to estimate the contributions of technological change and capital upgrading to output growth. There, productivity gains in terms of production factors are typically described to stem from (a) a process of capital deepening, i.e. a more extensive use of machinery relative to manual labour; as well as (b) an increase in productivity (defined as the ratio of value added created per employee in the production process). In most of the developing countries, the improvement in productivity is a result of the growth in capital stock – more machines replacing the mass of low skilled workers. On the other hand, increases of total factor productivity, i.e. technology growth as a result of the implementation of new technologies, is more apparent in developed countries. Without a further decomposition, expected impacts as seen in productivity may vary from the effect of capital deepening as opposed to the increase in capital per worker to the effect of pure technology growth. In this sense, productivity is an imperfect proxy of impact of technological change, yet its analysis allows one to derive important insights as far as the dynamics of production processes is concerned. The reason this tool puts particular emphasis on the role of productivity as opposed to capital deepening is threefold: First of all, productivity allows one to capture the ‘learning effect’ associated with the adoption of new technology, e.g. through the more efficient handling of new machinery over time. Secondly, obtaining concise measurement on capital stocks across industries is an advanced and rather technical exercise probably more suited for a more academic discussion and would certainly miss the scope and objective of EQuIP. Lastly, and most importantly, the concept of productivity is closely linked to two variables of high policy relevance: The measure of performance (value added) and reciprocity (employment) of an industry. It is at the core of the second tier (on technology absorption and productivity) of this tool to provide guidance on how productivity growth can be reconciled with the objective of increases in performance and reciprocity.</p>
<p>The central question linking the concept of industry 4.0 adoption and productivity growth are: What can we learn from past waves of technological change? Can past technological change tell us something about industry 4.0 adoption?</p>
<p>On the one hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies can be monitored year by year through opportune indicators. The preparedness for the possible impacts of industry 4.0 adoption on productivity and employment in different industries becomes a key element in anticipating possible responses to the adoption of industry 4.0. In that sense, no one can antedate what will be the consequences of industry 4.0 technology adoption; however, at least one can learn by analysing data from past waves of technological change. This is because the previous waves of technological innovations have been observed through the same productivity transmission channels as the most recent wave related to industry 4.0; and also has their adoption rate been determined by the degree to which they have facilitated an improvement in the production capacity across industries. Based on these insights, the following propositions can be derived:</p>
<p>Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all countries. The effects of the most recent wave of technological innovation will vary greatly across industries: Even though industry 4.0 will affect all countries and industries, the degree may differ substantially. Exemplarily, there is no reason to believe that industry 4.0 should only affect either high income countries or particular industries.
Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all industrial sectors. As with all previous industrialization waves, different countries adopt different strategies at different periods of time. Not because they were necessarily ‘too late’ but rather because their industrial composition demands a different policy approach than that of other countries.
Technological change is not always reflected in a simultaneous increase of manufacturing value added, productivity and employment, but it often generates trade-off. Some industries might have retained a productivity profile that is highly favourable for the economic development of the country in question. This, however, does not imply that the same approach would work for any other country.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> The impact of industry 4.0 on employment: different mechanisms at play, uncertain outcome.</h3>
<p>The concern of technological unemployment and will this time be different? In the economic development landscape today, certain milestones of productive capacities have become ever more complex: The labour forces in most of the economies are no longer dominated by undifferentiated mass of unskilled workers but characterized by workers with a dynamic skills portfolio. Consequently, the effects of automation can be counterbalanced by the creation of new complex tasks in which labour has comparative advantage1; even more so if skill-enabling technology is introduced. Such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - they reinstate labour into a broader range of tasks through reskilling and upskilling (Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo, 2019).
Automation replaces repetitive tasks and creates new, more complex tasks. Tasks previously performed by labour are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement labour, known as the labour augmenting effect. “The difference between human labour and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not.” (Leontief, 1958). Automation directly takes jobs away from unskilled labour who specialize in routine and repetitive tasks and new tasks tend to benefit skilled workers. This process increases social inequality in the short run, however, the standardization of new tasks over time tends to help low-skill workers to handle more complex tasks. To this extent, both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality in the short run, but it also presents the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run (Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo, 2017). The demands on employment and skills brought about by the fourth industrial revolution highlight the human capital as a key enabler to industrial development, where insufficient exposure to high-technology jobs can hinder the ability to adapt and respond to the disruptive changes expected from the industry 4.0 (WEF, 2017; Kraemer-Mbula, 2019).
Heterogeneous employment effects across types of jobs and industries are to be expected. Because manufacturing industries are characterized by different structures of labour-capital composition, it is likely the impact of automation on manufacturing which differs across industries. Moreover, different technologies are accompanied by productivity effects of varying magnitudes, and, hence, one set of automation technologies will not impact labour demand in the same way as others. As a matter of fact, there are multiple industries that can enjoy productivity dividends while enjoying employment generation; either because new production processes require manual input at different points of the production process (Autor, 2015) or because only particular tasks of an employee’s job description have been ‘rationalized away’ (Arntz, 2016).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Effective local and global demand may preserve both jobs and social well-being. In the context of manufacturing, the threat to employment is that as creative destruction unfolds, the destructive part is expected to fall primarily on industries with robot-based automation (Mayer, 2018). Rapid technological change has halved the price of industrial robots between 1990 and 2005 (Graetz and Michaels, 2016), this further catalyses the automation process in certain industries leading to potential jobless growth dynamics. On a positive note, economic policies could affect the impact of automation on aggregate demand. If productivity gains are shared and real wages grow in line with productivity growth, automation will tend to boost private consumption, aggregate demand and ultimately total employment. Obviously, in such cases, an important role is played by macro-prudential policies that operate to sustain effective demand, employment and standards of living within a country. Even if that is not the case, for some countries, employment could remain stable or even increase if the additional supply that results from automation-based productivity growth is absorbed through increased demand from exports. Robots boost companies’ international cost competitiveness, which may in turn spur exports and thereby make other countries bear at least part of the adverse consequences from robot-based automation through reduced output and employment opportunities.</p>

<p>In many countries there are great expectations regarding the potential of the latest wave of the digital technology evolution (also referred to as industry 4.0 throughout this tool) and its effect on the economy. International organisations such as the World Bank, the OECD as well as UNIDO have devoted large part of their resources to provide a better understanding on how these new technologies may reshape our economies; see Box X for more information.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this EQuIP module, we take a close look at the <strong>effect of industry 4.0 and the adoption of new technologies on the manufacturing sector</strong>. While this of course only allows us to cover parts of the effect the adoption of new, digital technologies, we provide a very clear and granular focus on the <strong>manufacturing industries and developing countries</strong> in particular. While this differentiates our efforts from other studies on this topic, we want to point out that the analysis conducted in this tool should be seen as a complementing rather than a holistic analysis on new technologies.</p>

<p>When considering the effect of technological revolutions on manufacturing processes, it is important to understand that technological evolution is hardly a one-way street. Rather
is is an important and interconnected part of a modern economy. Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a> illustrates this point: New technologies (such as industry 4.0) will only really be adopted into the production processes of an economy, if there is something to be gained from it. These potential gains could be manifold<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but typically always also effect the efficiency of a production process: If new technologies are allowing a company to produce more output with the same amount of input, they are eager to adopt this technology. If these technologies are adopted by many/all firms of country, their productivity gains reach macro-economic dimensions, and macro-prudential indicators will reflect the changes in the production dynamics which are the result of the newly adopted technology.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, new technology is rarely something that falls from the heavens. It is well understood that research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures are a great indicator of the success of a company: If a company tries to research how new technologies may improve their own production processes, this will not only set the company apart from less R&amp;D-engaged competitors but also result in the creation of new technology as a whole. In this sense, the pursuit of productivity growth also leads to the development of new technologies. It should become clear from this, that dimensions of ‘adoption of new technologies’ and ‘productivity’ are two sides of the same coin and should always be considered together.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the connection between the adoption of new technologies and productivity growth is a very complex question. As illustrated in Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a>, what glues these two domains together are the right <strong>capabilities and preconditions</strong> that are needed to allow for a successful communication of both domains. Because of the importance of this insight, a complete EQuIP tool (Tool 9: Industrial capability indicators) is dedicated to shed light on all the relevant dimensions that are needed to provide the right starting conditions for robust economic growth within - but not exclusive to - manufacturing.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section we move on to provide a clear conceptual framework on <strong>what is meant by industry 4.0</strong> and how it is integrated with digital manufacturing technologies with particular focus on developing countries. We then move on to discuss a way to measure and identify different kinds of productivity growth dynamics.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Adoption of new technologies in manufacturing</h4>
<p>Within the policy debate, many countries are orienting their industrial strategies and policies towards the adoption of technologies associated with the fourth wave of industrial innovation in the hopes that these new technologies can boost economic performance through increased productivity and by opening new markets.</p>
<p>The focus of this tool is in the intersection of the latest technology emerging in the digital and production technology and manufacturing production process. We refer to this domain as the <strong>smart factory</strong> which is populated by a very particular set of production technologies and concepts; see Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a> for more information.</p>

</div>
<p>At the same time it is important to recognise that digital technologies have had a long and successful past within the domain of manufacturing already and are not limited to the latest wave of digital technology.This is important to note: Industry 4.0 refers to some particular types of digital technology but not to all digital technology. This point is illustrated in Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> and shows a progression from analog production towards smart, digital technologies: Starting from analogue production, processes have become more integrated while also having moved from partial use of digital and ICT technologies.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>What is particularly important here is that Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> also allows us to identify a particular set of very narrowly defined concepts which can be related to (a) particular stage(s) of the digital technology pyramid. For example the domain of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing is most closely related to the smart factory stage. This is because for the large-scale production of goods through 3D printing, very specific and newly developed materials are required which belong to the technological frontier ( Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a>). CAD-CAM technologies<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> on the other hand allow for a large-scale of computer aided production process within manufacturing but a fully integrated logistical or digital network across areas is not required. Lastly, robots govern by fare the broadest domain of digital technologies. This is true as (simple) robots can be used to fulfil very rudimentary tasks with little to no complexity in rigid production process; however (smart) robots also form a central building block for smart factories. It is because of this complexity that we will pay very close attention to the adoption of robots and robot technology in one of the later parts of this tool.</p>

Questions for Nico: Should we add an info box pointing at all the categories as defined in the IDR questionnaire? Should we follow up on Alejandro’s suggestion on how to change this figure? Should we provide a narrow definition of what we mean by the the industry 4.0 goods clusters? particularly robots?
</p>
</div>
<p>While these three goods clusters allow us to identify very specific dimension in the adoption of industry 4.0 ready manufacturing technologies, they themselves are part of a much broader group of capital goods; see Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a>. This is an important insight as capital goods are of high relevance for a positive development path of the manufacturing industry <strong>CITATION/REFERENCE needed</strong>. Therefore, considering the three dimensions in Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a> jointly, we can empirically evaluate the intensity with which countries govern a particular domain of capital goods and where that would place them relative to global benchmarking cases. Whereas it will not be a surprise if a country which is leading in the development and distribution of additive manufacturing technology will also do well in other industry 4.0 goods, assessing the intensity of a particular developing country will certainly be more informative.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Productivity</h3>
<p>The central measure of productivity in this tool is that of labour productivity which is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country.
The growth rate of productivity can be approximated by the growth rate of value added generation minus the growth rate of employment as illustrated in the formula below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
growth(Labour~Productivity) = growth(Value~added) - growth(Employment)
\]</span></p>
<p>In simple terms, we will see an increase in productivity (a positive growth rate) if the same number of workers (employment growth of zero) generates more value added, e.g. by producing more goods, (a positive value added growth rate). Conversely, if one requires more employees to produce the same amount of value added, then the measured degree of productivity would have gone down (negative growth).</p>
<div id="introducing-runner-industries" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> Introducing: runner industries</h4>
<p>These simple fundamentals can be visualised in Figure <a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fig:fig5">2.5</a>, which illustrates the complex nature of productivity growth dynamics an economy might face: Exemplarily, positive productivity growth can either be brought about by a positive and higher growth of value added over also positive employment growth (also referred to ‘inclusive and tenable growth’ or ‘<strong>runner industries</strong>’) as well as positive value added and negative employment growth to which we will also refer as ‘jobless growth’. Lastly, positive productivity growth may also be reported if value added growth reduces less than employment growth (‘declining growth’).</p>

</div>
<p>From this it should become clear that not all forms of productivity growth are equally desirable; nor are all forms of a decline in productivity growth equally bad. This classification tool can help policy makers identify the nature of the structural dynamics of industrial sectors and assess as to whether they follow a more or less desirable regime. At the same time, the logical matrix allows to re-assess the classification of particular industries conditional on the time dimension considered: Exemplarily, industry 4.0 adoption in a particular industry might have led to an increase (or decrease) in the demand of employees which was not apparent in the pre-industry 4.0 era for that particular industry. By varying the time dimension of the analysis one can therefore identify and classify the changes of industry-specific dynamics after a set of policy interventions and/or market transformations.</p>
</div>
<div id="introducing-runner-industry-exposure" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.2</span> Introducing: runner industry exposure</h4>
<p>At the same time, it is interesting an important for policy makers to know how much of their economy follows a sustainable growth path in employment and productivity. We will capture this dimension through the analysis of <em>runner industry exposure</em>.</p>
<p>From the runner industry methodological (See Appendix <a href="rujust.html#rujust">D</a> for more information) we have seen that high income countries are those characterized by a high share of runners. This finding is crucial for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It shows that rich countries are those showing the highest share of sectors characterized by inclusive growth, meaning productivity, employment and manufacturing value added enhancing development. <em>Countries which became rich are the ones which were more exposed to an inclusive growth path.</em> This is a very important message: Growth does not necessarily need to pay a toll in terms of growth/employment trade-off.</p></li>
<li><p>Runner industries include low technology and medium high-technology industries alike. The fact that rich countries are those showing a higher share of runners means that in order to reach a high-income level, countries do not have to bet on medium high-technology industries alone. As mentioned earlier, there are many ways to the heaven and the message here seems to be that inclusive growth and within-industry structural change1 matters as well. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industry 4.0 debate as this latest wave of technological advancement will not create technologies that are exclusively confined to the domain of medium-high technology industry, but rather will also find their way into the lower technology segments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From a policy perspective, the analysis of the share of runners constitutes precious information for policy makers: First of all because the runner industry classification allows policy makers to identify jobless growth dynamics as part of the conceptual toolbox. If the uptake of industry 4.0 will be successful in a particular country (and more generally, if that country will be able to increase its production productivity either through capital deepening or other channels), a low share of runners flags a higher vulnerability to undesirable employment dynamics. In other words, this means that countries are more exposed to industries where inclusive and tenable growth was not achieved. Secondly, identification of such outcomes may call for a special attention of the policy maker potentially leading to an intervention with the aim to preserve inclusive and tenable growth by also considering the country specific characteristics developed in the next section. In this sense the runner industry classification may not only serve as an assessment but also as an early-warning tool in the context of a much wider policy intervention analysis.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Foster-McGregor, Nomaler, and Verspagen (2019) put forward a methodology to identify 4IR patents and traded goods. The focus is placed on four technologies: CAD-CAM, robotics, machine learning and additive manufacturing. Not only do they identify patents that can be associated with the above technologies, but they also look into trade statistics and identify those goods which can be associated with three of the above technologies: CAD-CAM, Robotics and Additive Manufacturing (see Box 1 for detailed HS classification of industry 4.0 goods). The other technologies typically related to the 4IR (such as big data, cloud computing and machine learning) are not considered since the most important part of these technologies is software which they can hardly be found in the trade classification.<a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In the automotive industry, advances in robotic technologies allow manufacturers to gradually automate a series of production tasks since the implantation of the first industrial robot in the 1960s. It does not come as a surprise that routine and repetitive tasks like welding and painting are now attended to by pre-programmed robotic arms without much of human intervention during the production process. It is evident that operative worker can be reskilled and reinstated to handle more complex tasks. For example, previously, inspection related tasks could only be handled by highly trained inspectors. With the aid of robotic vision technology, reskilled workers can now operate the inspection tasks without compromising on the quality. Automation in manufacturing has decreased production costs and reduced the price of manufactured goods. This pushes demand towards larger volume and may create more formal sector jobs. A study shows that about half of employment growth over 1980-2015 took place in occupations where job titles or tasks performed by workers changed (Lin, 2011).<a href="advocacy-and-concepts.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
