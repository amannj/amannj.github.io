<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In many countries there are great expectations for the potential of the latest digital technology revolution and its effect on the economy. The emergence of connected and communicating smart devices boosts the idea of breakthrough technologies which are rapidly penetrating international markets. This is as true for the manufacturing sector as it is for the economy as a whole: Exemplarily, maintenance is now progressively governed by modern robots which run through powerful algorithms that can predict when and where to replace materials in a firm’s production process and react instantaneously. Similarly, humans are increasingly rather supervisors of production processes than manual executors of operations.</p>
<p>At the same time, serious concerns on the socio-economic consequence on the adoption of these new and smart technologies have been voiced: There, the fear goes from the effect of jobless growth or potential job destruction all the way to the worry that modern technologies will result in a change in the economic development trajectory of developing countries. For example, the result of the re-shoring of previously outsourced production processes in the developing world could potentially lead to a situation where developing countries are not in a position any more to capitalise on the same comparative advantages (low-skilled workers that attract production processes) compared to earlier industrialisers. This could lead developing countries to lose out on a fundamental and historically well-documented steppingstone in their development stage.</p>
<p>With the mandate to provide a comprehensive and accessible approach to empirical policy benchmarking for the manufacturing sector, this EQuIP module seeks to provide a wide set of empirical instruments that allow for the identification and benchmarking of manufacturing-related dynamics that can be associated with the current wave of technological revolutions. In the literature this intersection of the <em>fourth technological revolution</em> and manufacturing is typically referred to as <em>industry 4.0</em> <span class="citation">(Anton, Silberglitt, and Schneider <a href="#ref-anton2001global">2001</a>)</span>. This tool also explores ways to measure how technology adoption is affecting the macroeconomic dimension of manufacturing development patterns and, most importantly, its potential effects on value added and employment generation.</p>
<p>For this purpose, this document is structured as follows: Section <a href="introduction.html#advocacy">2.1</a> provides a general discussion of the objective and purpose of this tool by linking the emergence of new digital technology with the necessity of a multi-dimensional and manufacturing-specific analysis. It also highlights the theoretical ramifications by pointing at the recent academic and policy-relevant literature. Section <a href="introduction.html#structure">2.2</a> narrows down the concepts of <em>what</em> industry 4.0 constitutes in the context of the manufacturing production process. Different dimensions will be discussed that one needs to take into consideration when trying to quantify the effect of <em>how</em> new and digital technologies may reshape the manufacturing industries of developing countries as we know them. The importance of looking at dynamics of changes in macroeconomic variables in order to understand the full scope of technological changes will also be stressed. Section <a href="methodology.html#methodology">3</a> then moves on to introduce a particular set of empirical indicators which will allow to quantify the effects of the adoption of new digital technology in manufacturing which are then applied in Section <a href="analysis.html#analysis">4</a> in a detailed cross-country study.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Industry 4.0: Manufacturing in the Digital Age</h3>
<div id="distinctive-in-nature" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.1</span> Distinctive in nature, …</h4>
<p>The fourth wave of technological innovations - which is characterized by the integration of digital connectivity and advanced technologies - gives rise to automated industrial systems and smart production processes that boost efficiency across economic activities. There is no doubt that this new wave of digital technology will inevitably reshape the face of the manufacturing sector as we know it. For example, this new wave encompasses the adoption of computers and automation enhanced by smart and autonomous systems. These in turn are fuelled by big data and complex artificial learning algorithms while digitally connected manufacturing embraces a wide variety of technologies, ranging from 3D printing to robotics, new materials, as well as biotechnology and smart production systems.</p>
<!-- Consequently, the definition of industry 4.0 adopted in the present module is anchored in digitalization concepts and includes physical and digital technologies such as analytic, artificial intelligence, cognitive technologies and the *internet of things (ITT)*^[The Oxford dictionary defines the term *internet of things (ITT)* as '[t]he interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.' ] alike.  -->
<p>It should become clear from this very broad definition that the effect of this new wave of digital technology will go way beyond the manufacturing sector and will also leave its marks on the service sector and the consumer market: <em>IoT products</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, such as autonomous cleaning robots or smart controls, that allow one to remotely control and change the room temperature of their house while being hundreds of kilometres away, have recently found their way out of <em>sci-fi</em> movies and into the lives of regular consumers. Even though exciting by themselves, this tool does not seek to analyse the effects these fantastic technologies may bring with them. Rather, our analysis focuses on the <em>production-related</em> dimension of manufacturing technologies. This distinction is important as the most recent digitalisation of the manufacturing production process also allows for the creation and distribution of different forms of <em>intangible assets</em> which are also of high relevance for the manufacturing industry: These include digital blueprints of production, different types of software, algorithms or, more generally, patents all of which complement the new and digital production cycle. This <em>intangible dimension</em> of the modern production process is a highly complex as well as regionally concentrated phenomenon where researchers have identified only a countable number of regions, countries and institutions to partake in this part of the modern economic process. While a selective summary of the trends and directions this field has taken in <strong>BOX 2.1</strong> is provided, the main focus of this tool is on the <em>tangible dimension</em> of the manufacturing production process. The reason for this is two-fold:</p>
<p>First of all, many highly recognised international organisations have sought out to analyse the effect of <em>intangibles</em> in this equation. For this they need very detailed and specific information on firms and products; see <strong>BOX 2.2</strong>. Such an analysis is granular by its own definition and makes it rather difficult to arrive at a comprehensive and comparable strata of results across industries and countries. Particularly for the developing world, such a micro-founded analysis may leave some important aspects for policy evaluation unanswered.</p>
<p>It is because of this that the purpose of this tool is somewhat different: Its goal is to provide policy makers <em>across the developing world</em> with tools to identify changes in the adoption behaviour of this new digital technology <strong>and</strong> to link it to macroeconomic outcome variables that lay at the heart of a policy maker: value added and employment. Because of this, the instruments proposed in this tool put special emphasis on the introduction of summary statistics that can be applied across a <em>broad group of countries and manufacturing industries</em> while retaining a high degree of space for interpretation and benchmarking. It goes without saying that this tool should therefore be seen as a complementing rather than a competing way of analysing the dispersion of digital technologies within manufacturing industries. A thorough analysis of this crucial question would therefore entail both a highly granular and micro firm-level data specific analysis together with this more macro- and cross-country oriented view on the effects of the adoption of digital technologies.</p>
</div>
<div id="yet-part-of-a-long-history-of-technological-change" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.2</span> … yet part of a long history of technological change</h4>
<p>At the same time, this tool stresses the importance of not only looking <em>across countries and industries</em> but also to keep the <em>time dimension</em> of manufacturing development in mind. This becomes obvious by recognising that the term <em>industry 4.0</em> already makes clear reference to the long history of three waves of technological change: Beginning in the late 18th century with the advent of steam power and the invention of the power loom, the first industrial revolution ushered in mechanisation and radically changed how goods were manufactured. In the late 19th century, electricity and assembly lines made mass production possible, giving rise to the second revolution. Many cite the third revolution as beginning in the 1970s, when advances in computing enabled pre-programmed machines and networks and thereby furthered automation. To that end, the fourth technological revolution signifies the current endpoint of technological evolution which allows us to connect machines and harvest their efficiency through coordination, automatised problem solving and the utilisation of new materials and production technologies.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that all technologies associated with their respective revolutionary waves in the past were considered to be of a destructive nature: The introduction of assembly lines revolutionised not only the car manufacturing industries, but also posed a great challenge for workers. The same is true for the textile and garment industry and/or the emergence of IT systems in the past. It is therefore important to recognise that also in the past, new technological discoveries created threats as well as opportunities for the people and companies at the time and that one can expect similar from the most recent, digital wave: As estimated in a recent study <span class="citation">(Frey and Osborne <a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span>, up to 47% of jobs have been identified to be ‘at risk of computerisation.’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Similar predictions have been made by among others by <span class="citation">Harari (<a href="#ref-harari201821">2018</a>)</span> who argues that past waves have shifted human activity from physical to cognitive activity. This latter technological wave leads to the possibility of cognitive tasks being undertaken by machines, leaving very little for humans since they have no other abilities beyond physical and cognitive.</p>
<p>While it is certainly true that with the emergence of even smarter and more sophisticated digital technologies the degree between digital/automatic and human skills have certainly increased, their consequences are to the current date still difficult to quantify and their scope and magnitude remain difficult to predict: Looking at job-related tasks rather than the jobs themselves, <span class="citation">Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> find a much lower risk of computerisation compared to the occupation-based approach as illustrated by <span class="citation">Frey and Osborne (<a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span>, while they do also find that there are some particular jobs and industries that are more at risk of job loss as a result of computerisation. Consequently, workers, industries and countries which differ in their sectoral composition of the economy and labour force may be at very heterogeneous risks and threats. This point is important as it means that the new digital technology will not only bring big challenges in the future, it will also create winners and losers and will potentially result in increased inequality which opens the mandate for strong policy interventions. For example, <span class="citation">Autor et al. (<a href="#ref-autor2018work">2018</a>)</span> has quantified the negative socio-economic effect of the disappearance of manufacturing jobs for young US American men that is due to an increase in international manufacturing competition. It is not unlikely that similar tendencies may be observed as a result of the adoption of new technologies in the developing world in the future.</p>
<p>It is therefore of the utmost importance for policy makers to be aware of both the chances as well as threats the adoption of new and digital technology will bring for the economy in general and the manufacturing sector in particular: Where new production technologies will generate unprecedented growth for some industries, it will stifle others. Old jobs will disappear and new, more high-skilled ones will emerge. Consequently, finding the right framework and incentive structure that allows for the formation of the right capabilities to foster the creation of modern industries and successful job transition through skill upgrading while fighting inequality and other negative side-effects in a time of digital production technologies will create a challenge environment for policy makers in the future. It is the goal of this EQuIP tool to provide a set of useful indicators that will policy makers help navigate these challenges.</p>

Waves of technological change and paradigm shifts, driven by the surge of scientific discoveries, have followed one another in accelerated succession. Because accumulated technological and productive capabilities of countries differ, a ‘role model’ of successful adoption which would suit all countries does not exist; nor is there a one-size-fits-all policy solution in responding to challenges and opportunities <span class="citation">(Lacasa et al. <a href="#ref-lacasa2019paths">2019</a>; Lee and Malerba <a href="#ref-lee2017theory">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>At the same time, the expectation of what the new wave of technological innovation could potentially bring to the table for the developing as well as developed world are at least twofold: For developed countries, industry 4.0 could be a way to regain manufacturing competitiveness. As for developing countries, industry 4.0 could provide a route to moving up the value chain, something that has become increasingly important to achieve in the face of rising labour costs.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> On the other hand, industry 4.0 could also lead to a further and more rapid reduction of manufacturing jobs in the developed world <span class="citation">(Frey and Osborne <a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span>, while countries excluded from the 4th industrial revolution (e.g. the poorest countries) could be affected by the uptake in other countries (e.g. rich countries embracing new technologies, allowing them to compete with the poorest countries). In other words, the comparative advantage in terms of plentiful and cheap low-skilled labour may be offset by the adoption of these new technologies in the rich world. In this sense, policy makers may be eager to adopt industry 4.0 technologies and to ‘jump on the bandwagon’ of the unfolding industrial revolution either in the hopes of boosting economic performance (productivity), or because of the fear of otherwise falling behind in the adoption of these new technologies. However, the creation and diffusion of newly emerging digital technologies has so far remained extremely concentrated at the world level: For emerging technologies such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM), robotics or additive manufacturing, it is documented that less than 10 countries explain 85% of all triadic patents<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> while 77% of all exports are directly associated with these technologies; see Appendix <a href="exporters.html#exporters">A</a>. At the same time, 84 countries remain excluded from the global creation and use of these technologies <span class="citation">(Foster-McGregor, Nomaler, and Verspagen <a href="#ref-FMcG2019">2019</a>; UNIDO <a href="#ref-IDR2020">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the same vein and from a policy strategy point of view, <span class="citation">Santiago (<a href="#ref-Santiago2019">2019</a>)</span> illustrates that most of the highly industrialised countries have already paved their ways accelerating the economic transformation to embrace industry 4.0 while developing countries seem to be lagging behind in this respect. The author documents that at least nine industrialising countries have announced national strategies around advanced manufacturing, a diversity of approaches, including industrial policies or science, technology and innovation plans, or standalone feasibility studies. Regarding developing countries, several middle-income economies, like the BRICS members, are already adopting smart manufacturing and are even entering areas traditionally reserved for highly industrialized countries <span class="citation">(Daudt and Willcox <a href="#ref-daudt2016reflexoes">2016</a>; López-Gómez et al. <a href="#ref-Lopez2017">2017</a>)</span>. For instance, China is adopting industrial development strategies that seek to capitalize on new windows of opportunity where it can benefit from its increasing ability to produce new technologies: Its search for value addition and enhanced technological content is superseding traditional cost advantage strategies <span class="citation">(Lee <a href="#ref-Lee2019">2019</a>)</span>. Apart from large developing countries, only a handful of smaller counterparts have defined or are in the process of developing strategic policy agendas around smart manufacturing; something which is rarely observed for the group of the least developed economies.</p>
</div>
<div id="and-the-importance-of-capabilities" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2.2</span> … and the importance of capabilities</h4>
<p>However, the willingness and, probably even more importantly, <strong>readiness</strong> of a country to adopt new technologies requires a minimum base of successfully developed industrial capabilities. <span class="citation">UNIDO (<a href="#ref-IDR2020">2020</a>)</span> shows a clear positive relationship between the adoption roles across different countries; both in terms of innovators and producers as well as, more generally, when it comes to the utilization of technologies associated with the 4th industrial revolution and their average set of industrial capabilities. Similarly, <span class="citation">Andreoni and Anzolin (<a href="#ref-andreoni2019">2019</a>)</span> have identified five categories of challenges which explain the gap between developing and developed countries when it comes to their engagement with industry 4.0 technologies and encompass areas such as basic capabilities, retrofitting and integration, digital infrastructure, the digital capability gap as well as access and affordability.</p>
<p>On the basis of this it should become clear that the development of the right capabilities and prerequisites form a crucial building block in the successful adoption of new and digital technologies. At the same time, the development of such ‘enablers of development’ go far beyond the immediate concept of digital technology adoption within manufacturing. Rather, they are fundamental for the successful development of a country as a whole. The EQuIP toolbox has long recognised the integral importance of the successful development of such capabilities and prerequisites and has created a specific tool for this: <strong>EQuIP TOOL 9: Industrial Capabilities Indicators</strong><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> captures a country’s different types of industrial capabilities to facilitate a better understanding of the role they play in industrial production, technological and structural change: Countries’ industrial capabilities are various types of firms’ competencies (associated with production and its organisation, technological change and innovations) as well as firms’ production capacity (determined by investments in machines, equipment and other capital goods). Countries’ industrial capabilities also relate to the physical and institutional infrastructure supporting the overall productive economy. This is why countries’ industrial capabilities are the main ‘drivers’ and ‘enablers’ of countries’ industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p>Because of its extensive nature, the interested reader is kindly referred to this particular tool for a more insightful and detailed discussion. At the same time, a further discussion on the role of capabilities in the wake of the emergence of new digital technology with a focus on firm-level evidence in developing countries is provided in <span class="citation">UNIDO (<a href="#ref-IDR2020">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Learning through adoption: Trade as the key channel of industry 4.0 technology adoption.</h3>
<p>Adoption and diffusion of technology across the ecosystem are fundamental steps to capitalize on the window of opportunity of industry 4.0. The experiences of some of the most successful manufacturing firms in East Asia suggest that learning is not possible without adoption. There, most of the successful firms were documented to have started with the adoption of foreign technology for production first and then learned from using and finally enhanced further productivity by mastering these technologies <span class="citation">(Lee <a href="#ref-Lee2019">2019</a>)</span>. For instance, South Korea and Taiwan followed in the footsteps of an early industrialiser, Japan. Similar episodes of imitate-to-innovate have also fuelled the successful emulation of new production processes and products in China.</p>
<p><strong>From latecomers to followers, benchmarking adoption is crucial.</strong> A key concern of today’s latecomers is whether they have invested enough resources at the national level as part of the adoption process of new technology in order to turn into a successful follower and, if not, how far they fall behind. An important insight from the historical perspective is that latecomers do not necessarily have to become original inventors of new technologies themselves. Rather, taking small, well-informed steps to test technological and policy options according to the goals desired, has proved to be the preferred strategy before fully committing to the implementation of the policy tool at hand. Building on this rationale, the main starting point to a successful adoption of industry 4.0 technologies among developing countries could either be that of a fast-paced adoption process of the emerging technologies or a more adaptive response to the local circumstances through incremental, follow-on innovations. In either case, the import of industry 4.0 goods<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> can be an indicator of adoption of technological change for developing countries.</p>

<strong>Contribution 1: The adoption of new technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>
The first contribution of this tool is to provide a simple set of measures to quantify the adoption of new technologies that are linked to the industry 4.0 domain across countries. This tool introduces a methodology that allows one to measure, quantify and categorise differences in technology adoption and diffusion strategies across economies through the trade structure of industry 4.0 goods.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> The impact of industry 4.0 on employment: different mechanisms at play, uncertain outcome.</h3>
<p><em>“The difference between human labour and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not.”</em> <span class="citation">(Leontief <a href="#ref-leontief1958theoretical">1958</a>)</span>. While this statement has most certainly been in the past, it has also been argued more recently, e.g. by <span class="citation">Harari (<a href="#ref-harari201821">2018</a>)</span>, that while past waves of technological revolutions have shifted human activity from physical to cognitive activity, the latest technological wave leads to the possibility of cognitive tasks being undertaken by machines. This may lead to a higher degree of competition between humans and machines and also leaves less room for humans overall, since they have no other abilities beyond physical and cognitive. In other words, automation replaces repetitive tasks and creates new, more complex tasks. At the same time, smart technologies may also ‘eat up’ parts of the cake. Will there be room for future employment despite these trends?</p>
<p>The labour forces in most of the economies are no longer dominated by an undifferentiated mass of unskilled workers but rather characterized by workers with a dynamic skills portfolio. Tasks previously performed by labour are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement labour, known as the labour augmenting effect. Consequently, the effects of automation could typically be counterbalanced by the creation of new complex tasks in which labour has a comparative advantage; even more so if skill-enabling technology is introduced. Such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - they reinstate labour into a broader range of tasks through re-skilling and up-skilling. Automation directly takes jobs away from unskilled labour who specialize in routine and repetitive tasks and new tasks tend to benefit skilled workers. This process increases social inequality in the short run, however, the standardization of new tasks over time tends to help low-skill workers to handle more complex tasks. To this extent, both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality in the short run, but it also presents the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run. These effects have been readily studied by the automation literature; see for example <span class="citation">Acemoglu and Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2017robots">2017</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Acemoglu and Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2018race">2018</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Acemoglu and Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2019automation">2019</a>)</span> or <span class="citation">Aghion, Jones, and Jones (<a href="#ref-aghion2017artificial">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As estimated in a recent study <span class="citation">Frey and Osborne (<a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span>, examine expected impacts of future computerisation on US labour market outcomes. According to their elaboration, about 47% of total US employment is at risk of computerisation. What is more, the study finds that wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with an occupation’s probability of computerisation. In other words, it is particularly the less educated and qualified working class population that are most effected by the emergence of smart digital technology. While it is certainly true that with the emergence of even smarter and more sophisticated digital technologies the degree of substitution between digital/automatic and human skills has certainly increased <span class="citation">(Frey and Osborne <a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>; Harari <a href="#ref-harari201821">2018</a>)</span>, their consequences are to the current date still challenging to quantify and their scope and magnitude remain difficult to predict: Looking at job-related tasks rather than the jobs themselves, <span class="citation">Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> find a much lower risk of computerisation compared to the occupation-based approach as illustrated by <span class="citation">Frey and Osborne (<a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span>, while they do also find that there are some particular jobs and industries that are more at risk of job loss as a result of automatability. Consequently, workers, industries and countries which differ in their sectoral composition of the economy and labour force may be at very heterogeneous risks and threats. This important insight has also been confirmed by <span class="citation">Nedelkoska and Quintini (<a href="#ref-nedelkoska2018automation">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>With the outcome on jobs remaining uncertain, two observations seem hardly disputed:</p>
<ul>
<li>For one, the demands on employment and skills brought about by the fourth industrial revolution highlight the human capital as a key enabler to industrial development, where insufficient exposure to high-technology jobs can hinder the ability to adapt and respond to the disruptive changes expected from industry 4.0 <span class="citation">(Kraemer-Mbula <a href="#ref-Kraemer2019">2019</a>; Leopold, Ratcheva, and Zahidi <a href="#ref-leopold2017future">2017</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Secondly, heterogeneous employment effects across types of jobs and industries are to be expected across countries<span class="citation">(Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn <a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>; Frey and Osborne <a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>; Nedelkoska and Quintini <a href="#ref-nedelkoska2018automation">2018</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because manufacturing industries are characterized by different structures of labour-capital composition, it is likely that the impact of automation on manufacturing will differ across industries. Moreover, different technologies are accompanied by productivity effects of varying magnitudes, and, hence, one set of automation technologies will not impact labour demand in the same way as others. As a matter of fact, there are multiple industries that can enjoy productivity dividends while enjoying employment generation; either because new production processes require manual input at different points of the production process <span class="citation">(Autor <a href="#ref-david2015there">2015</a>)</span> or because only particular tasks of an employee’s job description have been ‘rationalized away’ <span class="citation">(Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn <a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>From the above discussion it should be clear that the threat of automatisation is closely linked with country-specific characteristics and the configuration of the manufacturing sector: If a country’s manufacturing sector is not strongly developed in industries where digital technologies will have their greatest impact, the fear of computerisation-induced unemployment may be rather limited. On the other hand, if a country is particularly strong in these industries, computerisation may be of high relevance and should therefore be monitored closely. To that end, in order to quantify the risk of job loss that is due to computerisation, is important to narrow down the scope of the analysis and make it more precise: On the one hand, the focus will be on the type of computerisation that is most obviously connected to the potential of job loss in the developing world: In the context of manufacturing, the threat to employment is that as creative destruction unfolds, the destructive part is expected to fall primarily on industries with robot-based automation <span class="citation">(Mayer <a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span>. This is a highly dynamic area as rapid technological change has halved the price of industrial robots between 1990 and 2005 <span class="citation">(Graetz and Michaels <a href="#ref-graetz2018robots">2018</a>)</span> which means that industrial robots are probably closer to a cost-efficient substitute to human workers than ever before.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<strong>Contribution 2: Robots and job loss in manufacturing</strong>

The second contribution of this tool is to offer a set of instruments that allow policy makers to identify and quantify the (potential) threat in terms of employment loss that is due to the emergence and adoption of robot-based automation. It proposes a combination of a comprehensive set of indicators that allow for a country- and industry-specific benchmarking across countries.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> The view ahead: What to expect from industry 4.0 in the medium and long run?</h3>
<p>One economic fundamental is that any kind of technological innovation will only gain a foothold if it is beneficial for the firm to adopt the new technologies. In other words, only if the newly available technologies result in an improvement of the production processes by making them more productive, new technological possibilities will be integrated in the production processes of an economy. These fundamentals are as true for any previously adopted technology as they are in the context of the most recent wave of technological advancements: When countries plan their strategies for industry 4.0, their expectation is an increase of productivity in the production process while ideally preserving if not by increasing jobs through the opening of new markets.</p>
<p>The traditional neoclassical growth accounting method has been the standard method in the literature to estimate the contributions of technological change and capital upgrading to output growth. There, productivity gains in terms of production factors are typically described to stem from (a) a process of capital deepening, i.e. a more extensive use of machinery relative to manual labour; as well as (b) an increase in productivity (defined as the ratio of value added created per employee in the production process). In most of the developing countries, the improvement in productivity is a result of the growth in capital stock – more machines replacing the mass of low skilled workers. On the other hand, increases of total factor productivity, i.e. technology growth as a result of the implementation of new technologies, is more apparent in developed countries. Without a further decomposition, expected impacts as seen in productivity may vary from the effect of capital deepening as opposed to the increase in capital per worker to the effect of pure technology growth. In this sense, productivity is an imperfect proxy of impact of technological change, yet its analysis allows one to derive important insights as far as the dynamics of production processes is concerned.</p>
<p>The reason this tool puts particular emphasis on the role of productivity as opposed to capital deepening is threefold: First of all, productivity allows one to capture the ‘learning effect’ associated with the adoption of new technology, e.g. through the more efficient handling of new machinery over time. Secondly, obtaining concise measurement on capital stocks across industries is an advanced and rather technical exercise probably more suited for a more academic discussion and would certainly miss the scope and objective of EQuIP. Lastly, and most importantly, the concept of productivity is closely linked to two variables of high policy relevance: The measure of performance (value added) and inclusion (employment) of an industry. It is at the core of the second tier (on technology absorption and productivity) of this tool to provide guidance on how productivity growth can be reconciled with the objective of increases in performance and reciprocity.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The central question linking the concept of industry 4.0 adoption and productivity growth are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can be learnt from past waves of technological change?</li>
<li>Can past technological change predict industry 4.0 adoption?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the one hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies can be monitored year by year through opportune indicators. The preparedness for the possible impacts of industry 4.0 adoption on productivity and employment in different industries becomes a key element in anticipating possible responses to the adoption of industry 4.0. In that sense, no one can anticipate what will be the consequences of industry 4.0 technology adoption; however, at least one can learn by analysing data from past waves of technological change. This is because the previous waves of technological innovations have been observed through the same productivity transmission channels as the most recent wave related to industry 4.0; and their adoption rate has also been determined by the degree to which they have facilitated an improvement in the production capacity across industries. Based on these insights, the following propositions can be made:</p>
<p>Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all countries. The effects of the most recent wave of technological innovation will vary greatly across industries: Even though industry 4.0 will affect all countries and industries, the degree may differ substantially. Exemplarily, there is no reason to believe that industry 4.0 should only affect either high income countries or particular industries. Technological change did not happen in all industrial sectors to the same extent. As with all previous industrialization waves, different countries adopt different strategies at different periods of time. Not because they were necessarily ‘too late’ but rather because their industrial composition demands a different policy approach than that of other countries. Technological change is not always reflected in a simultaneous increase of manufacturing value added, productivity and employment, but it often generates trade-off. Some industries might have retained a productivity profile that is highly favourable for the economic development of the country in question. This, however, does not imply that the same approach would work for any other country.</p>

<strong>Contribution 3: The interplay between technological change and productivity growth</strong>
</p>
<p>
The third contribution of this tool is to link the current debate on technological revolution that is due to the emergence of smart digital technology to macroeconomic indicators across manufacturing industries. The instruments presented in this tool allow for a simple analysis of the differences in the dynamics of manufacturing industry’s productivity, value added and employment growth dynamics over time. It also proposes a simple way to analyse and compare country-specific industry profiles across aggregates and over time and furthermore defines a simple forward-looking tool to identify the direction into which a particular manufacturing industry is developing.

<p>For the purpose, this EQuIP module takes a close look at the <em>effects of industry 4.0 and the adoption of new technologies on the manufacturing sector</em>. Even though this of course only allows to cover parts of the effect of the adoption of new, digital technologies, a very clear and granular focus is provided on the <strong>manufacturing industries and developing countries</strong> in particular. While this differentiates the present efforts from other studies on this topic, it is important to point out that the analysis conducted in this tool should be seen as a complementing rather than a holistic analysis on new technologies.</p>

<p>
<strong>Box 2.2: Micro-level evidence on the effect of industry 4.0 in advanced economies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Different to the more cross-country and manufacturing-industry specific focus of this EQuIP module, other institutions have taken a more granular/specific look at the effect of digitalisation on productivity:
</p>
<p>
For example, <span class="citation"><span class="citation">Andrews, Nicoletti, and Timiliotis (<a href="#ref-andrewsOECD2018">2018</a>)</span></span> try to identify drivers of digital adoption for European countries while <span class="citation"><span class="citation">Gal et al. (<a href="#ref-galOECD2019">2019</a>)</span></span> study the potential for productivity growth coming from digital technology. Both papers resort to firm-level data for firms to look at firm-level characteristics and the gap between firms at the technological frontier and the rest. What is more, they use digital technologies such as access to high-speed internet, simple and complex cloud computing as well as back and front office integration systems.
</p>
<p>
What both papers find is that drivers of firm-level adoption are capabilities such as managerial and technical skills as well as business-related incentives such as the business environment in terms of competition. In essence, both papers conclude with the following policy suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Skills must be upgraded by enhancing initial education and training systems as they are prerequisites to adopt digital technology;
</li>
<li>
Infrastructure, such as access to broadband internet must be improved;
</li>
<li>
Barriers to starting firms must be lowered;
</li>
<li>
New competition policy for platform firms must be put into place;
</li>
<li>
Financial constraints, especially for young firms must be lowered and tax systems updated;
</li>
<li>
Lastly, it has to be stressed that it is usually a small fraction of firms at the technological frontier that adopt new technologies fastest. Digital adoption seems to be a strong indicator for productivity gains.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When considering the effects of technological revolutions on manufacturing processes, it is important to understand that technological evolution is hardly a one-way street; it rather is an important and interconnected part of a modern economy. Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a> illustrates this point: New technologies (such as industry 4.0) will only really be adopted into the production processes of an economy, if there is something to be gained from it. These potential gains could be manifold<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> but typically also affect the efficiency of a production process: If a particular new technology allows a company to produce more output with the same amount of input, it will be eager to adopt this technology. If these technologies are adopted by many/all firms of country, their productivity gains reach macro-economic dimensions, and macroeconomic indicators will reflect the changes in the production dynamics which are the result of the newly adopted technology.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, new technology is rarely something that appears out of nowhere. It is well understood that research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures are a great indicator of the success of a company: If a company tries to research how new technologies may improve their own production processes, this will not only set the company apart from less R&amp;D-engaged competitors but it also result in the creation of new technology as a whole. In this sense, the pursuit of productivity growth also leads to the development of new technologies. It should become clear from this, that dimensions of ‘adoption of new technologies’ and ‘productivity’ are two sides of the same coin and should always be considered together. The latter point is important as new digital technology will not only be restricted to a few sectors or industries but rather the economic configuration of the whole economy; see <strong>Box 2.3</strong> for a more details.</p>
<div class="rmdcomment">
<p>
<strong>Box 2.3: Digital technology industry classification.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span class="citation"><span class="citation">Calvino et al. (<a href="#ref-OECDtech">2018</a>)</span></span> proposes a taxonomy of sectors according to the extent to which they have gone digital. They build their indicator on a battery of measures of digital complexity such as the share of ICT tangible and intangible investment as well as purchases of intermediates, share of specialised personnel or the stock of robots (see original paper for more information).
</p>
<p>
While they find, that some sectors such as telecom and IT services are positioned consistently at the top of the distribution of sectors in terms of their adoption of new digital technologies, other industries vary more strongly across the proposed dimensions of the indicator. For within the manufacturing sectors, the authors identify the electrical equipment, machinery as well as transport equipment and electronics to be the most digitally intensive industries.
</p>
</div>
<p>At the same time, it goes without saying that the connection between the adoption of new technologies and productivity growth is a very complex question. As illustrated in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a>, what glues these two domains together are the right <strong>capabilities and preconditions</strong> that are needed to allow for a successful communication of both domains. Because of the importance of this component, <strong>EQuIP TOOL 9: Industrial Capabilities Indicators</strong> is dedicated to shed light on all the relevant dimensions that are needed to provide the right starting conditions for robust economic growth within - but not exclusive to - manufacturing.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section moves on to provide a clear conceptual framework on <strong>what is meant by industry 4.0</strong> and how it is integrated with digital manufacturing technologies with particular focus on developing countries. Then, a way to measure and identify different kinds of productivity growth dynamics is discussed.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Adoption of new technologies in manufacturing</h3>
<p>Within the policy debate, many countries are orienting their industrial strategies and policies towards the adoption of technologies associated with the fourth wave of industrial innovation in the hopes that these new technologies can boost economic performance through increased productivity and by opening new markets. What does this wave of new digital technology in manufacturing actually entail and how might it affect developing economies? To answer this, some concepts have to be defined first:</p>
<p>The focus of this part is to identify how new digital technologies enter into the domain of manufacturing: It is in the intersection of the latest technology emerging in the digital and production technologies and manufacturing production process. This domain is referred to as the <strong>smart factory</strong> which is populated by a very particular set of production technologies and concepts; see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.2: New technologies and advanced manufacturing.
</p>
</div>
<p>At the same time it is important to recognise that digital technologies have had a long and successful past within the domain of manufacturing already and are not limited to the latest wave of digital technology. This is an important insight: industry 4.0 refers to a <strong>number of particular types of digital technology but not to all digital technology</strong>. This point is illustrated in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> which visualises the progression from analogue production towards smart, digital technologies: Starting from analogue production, processes have become more integrated while also having moved from partial use of digital and ICT technologies;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> see also Table <a href="introduction.html#tab:itab">2.1</a> for more details on the kinds of production technologies in manufacturing that can be associated with each of the steps of the pyramid in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>What is particularly important here is that Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a> also allows us to identify a particular set of very narrowly defined concepts which can be related to (a) particular stage(s) of the digital technology pyramid. For example the domain of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing is most closely related to the smart factory stage. This is because for the large-scale production of goods through 3D printing, very specific and newly developed materials are required which belong to the technological frontier; see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a>. CAD-CAM<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> technologies on the other hand allow for a large-scale computer aided production process within manufacturing but a fully integrated logistical or digital network across areas is not required. Lastly, robots govern by far the broadest domain of digital technologies. This is true as (simple) robots can be used to fulfil very rudimentary tasks with little to no complexity in rigid production process; however (smart) robots also form a central building block for smart factories. It is because of this complexity that very close attention to the adoption of robots and robot technology will be paid in one of the later parts of this tool.</p>

<p>But before taking a look at robot technology in particular, it is important to understand that these three components are related to a much broader conceptual framework of goods: As Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a> shows, the three goods constitute what this module refers to as <em>industry 4.0 goods</em>, and they themselves are again part of the much broader group of that of capital goods. This is an important insight as capital goods are of high relevance for a positive development path of the manufacturing industry <span class="citation">(Howitt and Aghion <a href="#ref-howitt1998capital">1998</a>; Jorgenson <a href="#ref-jorgenson1963capital">1963</a>; Williamson <a href="#ref-williamson1971capital">1971</a>)</span>. Therefore, considering the three dimensions in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig4">2.4</a> jointly, allows to empirically evaluate the intensity with which countries govern a particular domain of capital goods and where that would place them relative to global benchmarking cases. Whereas it will not be a surprise if a country which is leading in the development and distribution of additive manufacturing technology will also do well in other industry 4.0 goods, assessing the intensity of a particular developing country will certainly be more informative.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig4"></span>
<img src="images/figure_4.png" alt="The family of capital goods." width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.4: The family of capital goods.
</p>
</div>
<p>Successful adoption of production technology in the context of this tool means using all forms of capital goods in the manufacturing production process; be it for producing consumer goods, intermediates or other capital goods. A simple way of finding out if firms use technology in this way on an aggregate level is to look at trade flows. As discussed above, machines - and the technology they represent - are often times imported as a first step of the adoption process. In order to determine if countries are ‘users’ (importers) or ‘producers’ (exporters) of such production technology, this tool develops a framework that will help policy makers in making this judgement. This tool also introduces a simple way that allows for a straightforward way to compare these dynamics across countries.</p>
<p>A country is classified as ‘specialized user’ of production technology if it imports more goods than the world average and as ‘specialized producer’ of production technology if it exports more than the world average. Comparing the resulting numbers of capital goods with 4.0 goods will provide important insights into how a country incorporates all vintages of production technology (capital goods) compared to goods related to the newest wave of technology (4.0 ), respectively.</p>
<p>The analysis below will show that only a small number of countries are exporting capital goods and especially 4.0 goods above world average and are thus coined ‘specialized producers’. These are usually high income countries that are considered technology leaders overall. For the user of the tool, to put results into more perspective and to benchmark a country to its peers, the classification will be related to a country’s income group. Also, some countries change their trade behaviour over time. This makes for some interesting insights: For example, as countries become richer and more technologically developed, they decrease their imports of capital goods but increase their exports. This points to fact that they increasingly develop the production technology themselves.</p>
<p>As our analysis will show, almost without exception (90%), countries that seem to successfully use (and produce) 4.0 goods also show this pattern with the broader group of capital goods. This confirms the idea of depicting technological waves as pyramid (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig3">2.3</a>). There seems to be little room for skipping single steps of this technological pyramid. On average, a country needs to have a solid manufacturing base in older technologies before developing skills and capabilities to use the newest technology.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Robots and job loss in manufacturing</h3>
<p>Before, the adoption of technology through trade dynamics was conceptualised. Now the consequences of <strong>successful integration</strong> of digital technologies is conceptualised as part of the manufacturing production process.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Most new technologies come with commercial potentials such as enhancing firms’ productivity. As discussed before, while the actual displacement effect of manufacturing jobs that is due to computerisation is still subject to debate <span class="citation">(Frey and Osborne <a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>; Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn <a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>; Nedelkoska and Quintini <a href="#ref-nedelkoska2018automation">2018</a>)</span>, what remains indisputable is its heterogeneous effect on the workforce, the manufacturing industries and therefore also the countries themselves <span class="citation">(Acemoglu and Restrepo <a href="#ref-acemoglu2017robots">2017</a>, <a href="#ref-acemoglu2018race">2018</a>, <a href="#ref-acemoglu2019automation">2019</a>; Aghion, Jones, and Jones <a href="#ref-aghion2017artificial">2017</a>; Bessen and Righi <a href="#ref-Bessen2019">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to shed light on this dimension, a robot dataset by the International Federation of Robotics <span class="citation">(IFR <a href="#ref-IFR">2019</a>)</span> will be used to analyse the potential job loss from robot-based automation in manufacturing industries. Industrial Robots are defined as ‘an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multi-purpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications’ <span class="citation">(IFR <a href="#ref-IFR">2019</a>)</span>. Robots are an integral part of the ‘smart factory’ and are source for improvements in productivity, especially when it comes to routine tasks. This is particularly important because these kind of routine tasks are especially frequent in manufacturing.</p>
<p>However, there is an additional argument to be made. As recognised by <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span>, manufacturing industries are not only frequently characterised as routine task-operated, but some of these tasks are also characterised as skill-complex. As <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span> notes, it is particularly these industries which are at high risk when firms adopt smart production technologies. This high skill complexity adds an additional economic argument of cost competitiveness to the discussion as to why firms may wish to replace high-skilled and expensive workers with new and smart technologies. This is why <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span> sees workers in some high(er)-technology manufacturing sectors more at higher risk of robot-based automation than others, say, lower-technology industries where automatisation rather than computerisation is expected to have the most adverse employment effects. In other words, countries with a severely under-developed manufacturing sector, and potentially a more (non-industrialized) agricultural configuration of the economy, are potentially not very likely to expect much automation-induced unemployment because of the emergence of improvements in production processes in the medium to high-technology industries.</p>
<p>The number of robots per worker will be combined with the relative size of the relevant sectors and the degree to which there might be already some saturation or maturity in the use of robots for some countries and sectors. These insights will be paired with that of the evolution of the degree of robotisation, i.e. the replacement of employees with industry robots, to obtain a clear few on the potential danger - as well as the severity of the replacement effect - a country may face in the context of industrial robotisation. The dimension analysed for this purpose are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of high risk industries (where worker replacement with smart robots is both technologically and economically feasible and desirable as argued by <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span>); only a relatively ‘high’ share of these industries would constitute a risk-prone industry configuration.</li>
<li>The relative size of manufacturing employment in total employment; only a relatively ‘high’ share will indicate that a large share of the employed population may be at risk of losing their jobs to smart digital robots.</li>
<li>The proportion of robots to employees within manufacturing; only if there are few robots relative to the number of employees a meaningful displacement effect may occur.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
<li>The degree at which robots are replacing workers; only if there is an active replacement of workers with robots, employees may indeed be at risk of losing their jobs. This dimension is captured by looking at the number as well as the growth rate of the number of robots per worker as the replacement risk depends on how many jobs have already been replaced as well as the pace at which this is happening.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>From the above it should become obvious that these four different dimensions can allow us to develop a detailed insight into country-specific dynamics as will be highlighted in the analytical part of this tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="advocProd" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Productivity</h3>
<p>As elaborated before, new technologies will only be adopted into the production process if they pay off, that is increase the productivity of production processes and will consequently also affect macroeconomic variables such as value added or employment. In order to analyse this dimension of the technology puzzle, one first has to find a good and accessible way to measure productivity. After that, productivity dynamics within manufacturing industries and also their differences on the industry level as well as across countries can be considered.</p>
<p>The central measure of productivity in this tool is that of labour productivity which is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country.
The growth rate of productivity can be approximated by the growth rate of value added generation minus the growth rate of employment as illustrated in the formula below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
growth(Labour~Productivity) = growth(Value~added) - growth(Employment)
\]</span></p>
<p>In simple terms, an increase in productivity will materialise (a positive growth rate) if the same number of workers (employment growth of zero) generates more value added, e.g. by producing more goods, (a positive value added growth rate). Conversely, if one requires more employees to produce the same amount of value added, then the measured degree of productivity would have gone down (negative growth). Consequently, it is important to note that positive growth rates will be present in all three aggregates if (and only if) <span class="math inline">\(growth(Value~added) &gt; growth(Employment)\)</span>.</p>
<div id="the-concept-of-runner-industries" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4.1</span> The concept of <em>‘runner industries’</em></h4>
<p>These simple fundamentals can be visualised in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig5">2.5</a>, which illustrates the complex nature of productivity growth dynamics an economy might face: Exemplarily, positive productivity growth can either be brought about by a positive and higher growth of value added and also positive employment growth (also referred to as ‘<strong>runner industries</strong>’) as well as positive value added and negative employment growth which will be referred to as ‘jobless growth’.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig5"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.5: Visualisation of the runner industry concept.
</p>
</div>
<p>From this it should become clear that not all forms of productivity growth are equally desirable; nor are all forms of a decline in productivity growth equally bad. The concept of <em>runner industries</em> can help policy makers identify the nature of the structural dynamics of particular manufacturing industries. As will be discussed in due course, the identification of runner industries can be undertaken for different time periods and one may arrive at different results as a consequence of that. As will be illustrated in Appendix <a href="runnertimes.html#runnertimes">B</a> results like these are by no means contradictory but can constitute important tools which can be used to fully understand the potential trajectory of an industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-concept-of-runner-industry-exposure" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4.2</span> The concept of <em>‘runner industry exposure’</em></h4>
<p>After having identified the set of runner industries with a particularly positive performance patterns, it is interesting and important for policy makers to know how much of their economy follows a sustainable growth path in employment and productivity. This dimension will be captured through the analysis of <em>runner industry exposure</em>. For this, the contribution (share) of runner industries in manufacturing of a particular country will be investigated.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, the analysis of the share of runners constitutes precious information for policy makers: First of all because the runner industry classification allows policy makers to identify jobless growth dynamics as part of the conceptual toolbox. If the uptake of industry 4.0 will be successful in a particular country (and more generally, if that country will be able to increase its production productivity either through capital deepening or other channels), a low share of runners flags a higher vulnerability to undesirable employment dynamics. In other words, this means that countries are more exposed to industries where inclusive and tenable growth was not achieved. Secondly, identification of such outcomes may call for a special attention of the policy maker potentially leading to an intervention with the aim to preserve inclusive and tenable growth by also considering the country specific characteristics developed in the next section. In this sense the runner industry classification may not only serve as an assessment but also as an early-warning tool in the context of a much wider policy intervention analysis.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Appendix <a href="rujust.html#rujust">C</a>, the contribution of runner industries matters on a global level. As it turns out, the share of runner industries in developed countries is notably higher than in developing countries. This is important because it shows that rich countries are those showing the highest share of sectors characterized by inclusive growth, meaning productivity, employment and manufacturing value added enhancing development. <em>Countries which became rich are the ones which were more exposed to an inclusive growth path.</em> This is a very important message: <strong>Economic growth and the adoption of new technologies does not necessarily entail a toll in terms of growth/employment trade-off.</strong></p>
<p>Further, runner industries may include low technology and medium high-technology industries alike. The fact that rich countries are those showing a higher share of runners means that in order to reach a high-income level, countries do not have to bet on medium high-technology industries alone. As mentioned earlier, there are different ways to success and the message here seems to be that inclusive growth and within-industry structural change matters as well. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industry 4.0 debate as this latest wave of technological advancement will not create technologies that are exclusively confined to the domain of medium-high technology industry, but rather will also find their way into the lower technology segments.</p>

<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Summary</h3>
<p>This section provides a short summary of the analytical instruments proposed in this tool. The discussion is complemented by Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:fig6a">2.6</a> which illustrates how the dimensions of the analysis are connected: While for industry 4.0 the focus is on the adoption of new technology and the effect of robotisation in manufacturing.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig6a"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>As far as the productivity domain is concerned, the connection between robotisation, high technology and runner industries (linking industry 4.0 technology with productivity) was highlighted and pointed out that countries with the highest runner exposure share, i.e. advanced economies, are the ones that are most dominant in the trade and creation of advanced manufacturing technologies.</p>
<p>As the empirical part will show, there is very high correspondence between the dimension of industry 4.0 (and new technologies as a whole) and that of productivity: The industries that are identifiable as having a higher risk of robotisation after <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span>, by and large also belong to the set of industries that are categorised as medium- high-technology by the <span class="citation">OECD (<a href="#ref-oecd2011">2011</a>)</span>. Most interestingly, this classification of this medium- high-technology separation builds on the R&amp;D expenditures of the particular industries. This means that these industries are the ones that have most strongly put resources into the development of new and the refinement of already existing technologies. From the earlier discussion, the overlap between these industries and the most AI-driven sectors <span class="citation">(Calvino et al. <a href="#ref-OECDtech">2018</a>; Vincent, Vertesy, and Damioli <a href="#ref-Vertesy2019">2019</a>)</span> should also be obvious.</p>
<p>Have these technologically more engaged industries been the ones that have most significantly been affected by employment displacement? As discussed before, industry 4.0 technologies may most certainly impose a challenge for policy makers in the future, automatisation has itself always been a central component of the manufacturing process, and it has particularly been of the utmost importance for capital-intensive industries of high(er) technological sophistication. Using the concept of runner industries can easily and conveniently quantify the characteristics of these industries: Have these industries experienced the most significant reduction of employment because of automatisation? Or have these industries not only displaced workers but also created new jobs as a consequence of their technological advancement?</p>
<p>As our runner analysis will show, the latter has been the case: There is notable overlap between more R&amp;D-heavy industries and runner industries. While it is also true that is typically this group of industries that has to some extent be highlighted by <span class="citation">Mayer (<a href="#ref-mayer2018robots">2018</a>)</span> to be at higher risk of computerisation, it is the same set of industries that has shown to exhibit the most robust and sustainable inclusive growth path. To this end, the golden thread of ‘creation through destruction’ not only sews together the empirical analysis of this tool, it is also closely tied to the findings of the automation literature discussed earlier <span class="citation">(Acemoglu and Restrepo <a href="#ref-acemoglu2017robots">2017</a>, <a href="#ref-acemoglu2018race">2018</a>, <a href="#ref-acemoglu2019automation">2019</a>; Aghion, Jones, and Jones <a href="#ref-aghion2017artificial">2017</a> among others)</span>: Technological advancements are very likely to increase social inequality in the short run; however, it also creates the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run. Consequently, policy makers need not only be made aware of these dynamics, they are also to be given the right tools to assess and tackle the challenges that come with the latest revolution of smart digital technologies.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The Oxford dictionary defines the term <em>internet of things (IoT)</em> as ‘[t]he interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.’ <a href="introduction.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In this study, <span class="citation">Frey and Osborne (<a href="#ref-freyosborne2017">2017</a>)</span> refer to the term <em>computerisation</em> as ‘job automation by means of computer-controlled equipment.’ (p.2)<a href="introduction.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>It is important to note that this claim is formulated on the basis of a hypothetical argument: In order to claim this, research on how industry 4.0 changes the concept and organization of value chains would be needed.<a href="introduction.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Triadic patents are a series of corresponding patents filed at the European Patent Office (EPO), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO), for the same invention, by the same applicant or inventor <span class="citation">(OECD <a href="#ref-oecd2005">2005</a>)</span>.<a href="introduction.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>See the EQuIP website at <a href="http://www.equip-project.org" class="uri">http://www.equip-project.org</a> for more information.<a href="introduction.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><span class="citation">Foster-McGregor, Nomaler, and Verspagen (<a href="#ref-FMcG2019">2019</a>)</span> put forward a methodology to identify industry 4.0 patents and traded goods. The focus is placed on four technologies: CAD-CAM, robotics, machine learning and additive manufacturing. Not only do they identify patents that can be associated with the above technologies, but they also look into trade statistics and identify those goods which can be associated with three of the above technologies: CAD-CAM, Robotics and Additive Manufacturing (see Appendix <a href="i40goods.html#i40goods">F</a> for a more detailed classification of industry 4.0 goods). The other technologies typically related to industry 4.0 (such as big data, cloud computing and machine learning) are not considered since the most important part of these technologies is software which they can hardly be found in the trade classification.<a href="introduction.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>In the automotive industry, advances in robotic technologies allow manufacturers to gradually automate a series of production tasks since the implantation of the first industrial robot in the 1960s. It does not come as a surprise that routine and repetitive tasks like welding and painting are now attended to by pre-programmed robotic arms without much of human intervention during the production process. It is evident that operative worker can be reskilled and reinstated to handle more complex tasks. For example, previously, inspection related tasks could only be handled by highly trained inspectors. With the aid of robotic vision technology, reskilled workers can now operate the inspection tasks without compromising on the quality. Automation in manufacturing has decreased production costs and reduced the price of manufactured goods. This pushes demand towards larger volume and may create more formal sector jobs.<a href="introduction.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>An industrial robot is defined by the International Federation of Robotics <span class="citation">(IFR <a href="#ref-IFR">2019</a>)</span> as ‘an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multi-purpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications’; see (ISO 8373) standard obtained from <a href="https://ifr.org/industrial-robots" class="uri">https://ifr.org/industrial-robots</a>.<a href="introduction.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>A question often raised by researchers is that of why we haven’t seen a response to these new technologies in terms of productivity improvements since productivity itself has remained rather stagnant over time in aggregate terms. As it turns out, this is indeed an active field of academic research. While some <span class="citation">(Gal et al. <a href="#ref-galOECD2019">2019</a>, among others)</span> stress the stronger divide <em>across</em> firms between a small sat of incredible innovative and dynamic and a bigger chunk of less adaptive firms, others <span class="citation">(Esfahani, Fernald, and Hobijn <a href="#ref-Esfahani2019">2019</a>, among others)</span> emphasise that productivity aggregates have simply bounced back from a phase of acceleration during the first IT revolution. It goes beyond the scope of this EQuIP tool to offer further insights into this lively academic debate.<a href="introduction.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Consider for example cleaner production, higher working standards etc<a href="introduction.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>For the remainder of this tool the term ‘productivity’ refers to labour productivity as will be defined in the methodology part of this tool. Conceding that labour productivity is only one form to capture the efficiency of production processes, still the focus on this rather simple variable is retained in a straightforward and - in terms of data coverage - broad measure.<a href="introduction.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Information and communications technology (ICT) extends on the concept of information technology (IT) to emphasise the important of amplified communications integration of (tele)-communication devices such as telephone lines, wireless signals and computers etc., as well as the necessary enterprise software, middle ware, storage, and audiovisual systems, that enable users-access to store, transition, and manipulation information.<a href="introduction.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>CAD-CAM stands for Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing.<a href="introduction.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>As noted before, this successful integration is a very hard and challenging path and depends on many dimensions and in particular on the successful implementation of necessary prerequisites and capabilities all of which are discussed in great detail in EQuIP TOOL 9: Industrial Capabilities Indicators.<a href="introduction.html#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Conversely, assume that most workers have already been replaced by robots. In such a scenario it would be nonsensical to still talk about a ‘high risk’ of robotisation.<a href="introduction.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Assume that there is currently no replacement of workers with robots recorded for a particular industry. While this does not imply that there will not be such a scenario in the future, the immediate risk of a worker losing his/her job to a robot may be still considered comparably low.<a href="introduction.html#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
