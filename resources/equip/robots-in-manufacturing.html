<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 6</span> Robots in Manufacturing</h1>
<p>We now focus on robots in particular. On the one hand, we can get more detailed insights into one product group where countries show increasing import shares (see Chapter <a href="#ch:diff40"><strong>??</strong></a>) and on the other hand, when we think of jobs being at risk of automation, it is mostly robots that come to mind. As Mayer (2018) points out, the manufacturing sector is characterised by a number of routine jobs and therefore particularly exposed to the potential substition of labour by robots.
We first measure the development of robots used compared to human labour (robot intensity) and subsequently, the risk of job loss from automation. We lose some Countries (e.g. Georgia) in the analysis due to data limitations of the robot dataset.</p>
<div id="robot-intensity-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Robot intensity</h2>
<p>Robot intensity measures the ratio of the number of robots relative to the number of employees (indicator XX). On the downside, this indicator is narrowing its focus to the dimension of robots alone, whereas previous indicators were based on a broader range of industry 4.0 goods consisting of CAD - CAM, additive manufacturing and robots. Consequently, results presented in this section should always be interpreted in the context of robotics and are therefore not necessarily representative for the wider range of industry 4.0 related technologies or the wider adoption capabilities of any of the countries considered in this exercise.</p>
<p>However, as the ‘smart factory’ is mostly about intelligently connecting machines (robots) and other parts of the production process, the use of industrial robots is a first indicator of how relevant or prepared countries are in this respect. Thus, we will look at the intensity of robots used in the production process by calculating the stock of robots per 1 million employees. If this ratio is increasing, we can interpret it as a measure of progress of a countries industrial automation capacities.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#fig:rob-intens">6.1</a> shows the robot intensity on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is logged, so large values are much larger than low values. The figure replicates the patterns from above. Industrialised countries, such as Japan, Rep. of Korea or Germany already use up up to 80,000 robots per 1 million employees. On the other hand, in Viet Nam or the Russian Federation they range below 1,000 per million employees. In total, with the exception of Japan, all selected countries show an increase in robot intensity over time.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Manufacturing employment risk exposure</h2>
<p>All observed countries increased their robot intensity over time. Against this background, an important dimension of the discussion surrounding new technology, are the potential benefits and risks of new technology. In the context of robots, it is the effect of robot-based automation. In a similar way to the employment composition analysis in EQuIP Tool 5: Employment Composition we can quantify the risk of manufacturing employment exposure stemming from automation. This concept is of particular complexity as automation itself is technology-biased and more likely to affect industries (and countries) which are high in capital intensity. This makes the issue of employment risk exposure a particularly multifaceted concept which depends on numerous factors. Three main components are discussed in the remainder of this section.</p>
<p>The first and most straight forward factor is that of the existence of a solid manufacturing basis. Countries with a severely under-developed manufacturing sector, and potentially a more agricultural configuration of the economy, are potentially not very likely to expect much automation-induced unemployment because of the emergence of improvements in production processes in the medium to high-technology industries.</p>
<p>Under the assumption of a well-developed manufacturing basis, the effect of automation-induced unemployment further depends on the industrial composition of a country’s industry. A recent study (Mayer, 2018) identifies the manufacturing share as a second important variable representing a threat of job destruction from industry 4.0 penetration. The argument is that the manufacturing sector is the one more characterized by routine jobs and sensitive to robot/human capital substitution. He identifies a subset of manufacturing industries that are considered to be at a high-risk of automation (see Table <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#tab:risk-sec">6.1</a>). As he points out, “job displacement by robots in relatively skill-intensive and well-paying manufacturing, such as the automotive and electronics sectors, is more profitable than in relatively labour intensive and low-paying sectors, such as apparel” and that “economic factors are more important for robot deployment than the technical possibilities of automating workers’ tasks”. Of course this set of industries might change over time when other sectors become more skill intensive or when the technology evolves.</p>

<p>Applying this industry classification of high-risk industries to our country sample, Figure <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#fig:riskexposure">6.2</a> shows the share of workers in sectors Chemicals, Rubber and Plastic, Electrical Appliances as well as Automotive Vehicles (indicator XX). It illustrates the notably higher exposure shares for the set of advanced economies of our sample (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea) while the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and Georgia report a relatively low and stable trend over time. Given its dynamic growth and aspiration to become a technology leader itself, the trade-off between technological advancement and employment risk exposure becomes very obvious for the case of China: Within 10 years (between 2007 and 2017) China has increased its exposure share by around 7 percentage points and now closes in to the group of most advanced economies.</p>

<p>Robots are used in different industries to different degrees. In 2016, for our country sub-sample, two thirds of robots were employed in Automotive and Electronics, which overlaps with the sectors identified above. There is considerable variation across countries. Germany uses robots relatively intensely producing cars compared to to other industries. The Republic of Korea and Japan do so even more and additionally are robot-intensive producers of electronics. Viet Nam, the Russian Federation or China use robots much less intensely with China relatively evenly across industries and the Russian Federation more skewed towards automobiles and Metals. Viet Nam uses robots relatively more intensely in the production of plastic and chemical products.</p>

<p>Similarly to the previous chapter, we have to combine indicators in order to get to preliminary conclusion if workers are at risk of robot-based automation. In order to do that and as one way of reaching a conclusion, we follow Mayer (2018) in looking at a large sample of 111 countries to see if we find more general patterns. Figure <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#fig:mayer">6.4</a> relates average (2002-2016) risk sector employment (indicator XX) to total manufacturing employment (indicator XX). Further, we can distinguish countries by income group and by their average robot intensity (size of points, indicator XX).</p>
<p>Overall, there is a positive correlation between the share of employment in manufacturing and the share of employees in the risk sectors. Grouping countries by income, we can see that employees in developed as well as in upper middle income countries are, on average, more exposed to risk of job loss due to automation, while least developed countries are not (yet) strongly exposed. We also see, that high income countries display higher robot intensities, confirming previous graphs.
We can divide the graph into 4 quadrants. The top-left quadrant includes countries, where employment in risk sectors is relatively overrepresented. For example, in Mexico, 5% of all employees are in manufacturing industries. However, of those, over 30% are employed in risk sectors. Countries in the top-right quadrant show a high number of manufacturing employees overall and in risk sectors as well. In large parts, these are high-income and upper-income countries that already show the most intense robot use (size of symbol).</p>
<p>These findings also pose a challenging conundrum: On the one hand they are suggestive of the interpretation that robot-based automation will not invalidate the important role of industrial development for less-developed economies per se; on the other hand, the fact that the use of robots is positively correlated with more high-skilled industries may bring about an even greater challenge to less-developed countries when it comes to sectoral upgrading. Basically, countries that want to increase their high-tech industry shares might, at least temporarilly, expose part of their labour to the risk of jobloss due to automation.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:mayer"></span>
<img src="I40_Productivity_files/figure-html/mayer-1.png" alt="Vulnerability to robot-based automation" width="864" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 6.4: Vulnerability to robot-based automation
</p>
</div>
<p>This last observation brings us to the third factor vital to the identification of manufacturing employment risk exposure; namely that of (non-) maturity of a country’s automation tendencies. This means, if a country shows signs of not increasing their robot intensity further. We can analyse this dimension by comparing the growth of robot intensity (indicator XX) of a country with the actual number of robots relative to the number of employees, i.e. robot intensity (indicator XX). This approach constitutes a simple stock-flow analysis and allows one to identify any changes in the robot-related adoption dynamics of a country which could be interpreted as a maturation effect: a low and static growth rate of robot intensity given a high relative number of robots per employee.
For countries with such a maturity profile, the actual threat of job losses related to automatization is relatively low even though the risk of job-loss in the particular industry may remain high as a consequence of technological advancements. This profile puts them out of the ‘danger zone’ where technological advancements may bring about at least short-run involuntary employment disruptions. Conversely, countries which have not reached this stage of maturity yet can indeed be at risk of high robot-based automation vulnerability if they show a high growth rate in robot intensity as well as a steady increase in the stock over time. footnote(Conversely, a levelling out of the robot intensity growth rate at around zero with a robot stock significantly lower than that of more advanced countries could allow one to identify cases where the technology gap between leading economies and developing ones has increased to a degree from which industrial up-scaling has become practically infeasible (Mayer, 2018).)</p>
<p>As is evident from Figure <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#fig:mayer">6.4</a>, the findings by Mayer (2018) suggest that countries characterized by a composition of the manufacturing sector tilted towards electronics, automotive and chemical industries are more vulnerable to job displacement because there job displacement is more profitable. A higher risk of job displacement could be associated with a higher robot intensity because countries which have already adopted robot technology more extensively, are also more inclined to continue with their robotization efforts because they already own all the necessary capabilities. However, this process is only expected to continue until countries reach a certain level of maturity in robotization. After that point it is unlikely that countries can continue to inject robots in the production system, and they will rather try to upgrade towards higher generations of industry 4.0 including artificial intelligence, big data and CAD – CAM. Therefore, risk of job displacement to manufacturing employment in emerging countries may be more apparent.</p>
<!-- What is more, the institutional capabilities and industrial automation capacities of countries are inextricably intertwined as a result of long-term commitments from the society, agents and stakeholders alike. Such countries characterized by strong institutional capacity building regimes continuously invest in retraining and up-scaling existing workers as part of the social contract. As such, job displacement arising as a consequence of the introduction of new disruptive technologies might therefore only manifest in a relatively short period of involuntary unemployment spells. -->
<p>Figure <a href="robots-in-manufacturing.html#fig:robmaturity">6.5</a> shows the annual (2002-2015) growth rate of robot intensity on the Y-axis and the robot intensity on the X-axis. Technology leaders, such as Germany and Japan can be described as having reached a degree of maturity with a high yet very static degree of robot intensity over time. The Republic of Korea still seems to expand it’s robot intensity despite leading the pack already in 2014. Compared to the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and China seem to expand their relative stock of robots, albeit from a low level.</p>

Figure 6.5: Maturity effect of automation
</p>
</div>
<p>This chapter has shown that we have to combine different indicators to get a coherent picture of the automation processes. Although some sectors may show a higher likelihood of replacing labour by robots, it also matters which stage (maturity) the robotisation has already reached. If a country’s goal is to increase the degree of automation in the production process, at first it might expose labour to some risk of being replaced by robots, especially in mid- to high technology sectors. Once there is some maturity effect in the adoption of robots, the risk decreases again. Policy makers must be aware of the possible necessity to ease the transition for workers in the time of upgrading.</p>
<p>This concludes the empirical section where we have presented sets of indicators that can help understand technology adoption and the short run risks and long run benefits that can come with it. Chapter <a href="#ch:"><strong>??</strong></a> introduced the concept of ‘runner’ industries … Chapter @ref() showed a way of classifying countries as technology leaders or followers and distinguished overall capital goods and industry 4.0-ready goods.
