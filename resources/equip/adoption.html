<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 5</span> Adoption of new technologies</h1>
<p>When it comes to the generation of new technologies, economies can either create these themselves or import them. It has been widely established in economic research that the latter is more common and probably also easier to attain from the point of view of a developing country: Particularly for industry 4.0 technologies, there is a clear group of leading economies which push the frontier of digital technologies in manufacturing outward. It is typically this technology that then gets distributed through trade across the globe. Consequently, it makes sense to investigate, how the trade dynamics between these leading economies and the rest of selected countries differ. In order to measure trade dynamics we resort to different indicators of import and export indicators. We do this to highlight different speeds and intensities of technology adoption across countries over time.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this exercise we consider a heterogeneous group of countries. This group consists of a set of advanced economies (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea), all of which are big players in the adoption and generation of new technologies (see Box 1). The list of countries is complemented by a group of emerging economies (China, the Russian Federation as well as Viet Nam and Georgia). These countries have been selected with the purpose to illustrate particular development patterns observed in the adoption strategies of industry 4.0 technologies.</p>
<p>As we have seen in Chapter <a href="#ch:advI4"><strong>??</strong></a> industry 4.0 technologies are a sub-group of capital goods. Whereas the former identify cutting-edge technologies one is most likely to find in modern, state of the art manufacturing facilities, capital goods cover a much broader domain. Capital goods are machinery and other manufactured goods which are used by industry, government and non-profit private institutions. They are in fact producers’ goods that are defined as part of fixed capital formation. (UN, 2002)</p>
<p>However, it goes without saying that capital goods form one of the central building blocks of a healthy and growing manufacturing sector: Economic research has demonstrated that manufacturing provides great potential for positive growth trajectories through its scalability and high degree of capital accumulation, both of which can be identified through the utilisation of capital goods.</p>
<p>Consequently, we begin our analysis on the level of the capital goods group which can be understood to represent both the latest as well as already more established production technologies. We then move on to apply the same tools for the sub-group of capital goods that allow us to identify industry 4.0-specific dynamics. We do this with the goal to provide a simple tool for policy makers to analyse and categorise where their own economy stands relative to other economis and the global level, both in the utilisation of capital goods as well as industry 4.0-ready technology as part of the domestic production processes.</p>
<p>However, it must be stressed that the mere adoption of new technologies through importation does not guarantee the local absorption and diffusion. For this to be a successful strategy, the pre-conditions and enabling environment of a country matter. In other words, in order to move from being a follower to a leader more is needed than technology imports from abroad. For a successful adoption of these technologies and the establishment of state-of-the-art technology in a country, a strong foundation of prerequisits and capabilities is needed (see EQuIP too 9).</p>
<div id="capital-goods-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Capital goods</h2>
<p>The first graph (Figure <a href="adoption.html#fig:cap-goods">5.1</a>) shows shares of imports of capital goods in all goods (indicator xx) between 2002 and 2017. A number of interesting points emerge. Advanced economies (Germany, Japan, Rep. of Korea) display relatively low import shares that are stable or slightly decreasing over time. This does not mean that these countries are not adopting technology via imports but, as we will see when we look at their exports below, they are increasingly producing capital goods themselves, they are leading exporters. Georgia also shows low shares of imports but also low shares of exports, so in this case, we can think of Georgia as slow adopter of technology. In China, Viet Nam and the Russian Federation, imports of capital goods made up a larger share of total imports and thereby potentially introducing new technology at higher, but also decreasing, rates.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cap-goods"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>An immediate question arising from this initial analysis is that of how policy makers can obtain a benchmark relating country performance patterns to global dynamics. For this, and to get a better understanding of how to interpret different importing behaviour, we have to also look at exports. This way, we can find out if a low import share can be a sign of a technology leader (such as Germany, Japan or Rep. of Korea) that is no longer importing technolgy or of a country not (yet) able to adopt new technology.</p>
<p>We propose two indicators to facilitate this requirement: By calculating the import shares relative to the world average (indicator xx), one can quantify the import performance of a country in relation to the world average. This relation is called ‘revealed comparative advantage’ (RCA). If a country is characterized by an import RCA larger than one, this means that it imports more than the world average. In turn, this could point to a faster adoption of technology for countries that are not yet at the technological frontier.
In that sense, the RCA of imports (indicator xx) is strongly connected to the adoption rate (indicator xx) as both indicators depend on the share of goods in total imports. We will see the same overall import profiles across countries with both indicators but the interpretation changes.
<!-- The difference between both of them lies in the fact that RCA (import) is normalized by the import share of world countries which would allow policy advisor's to assess the performance of a country individually and without having to resort to a group of country comparative to see where a particular country stands in global terms. -->
As the second indicator, RCA exports (indicator XX), serves as a key measure to detect the local capabilities of countries in producing goods. As before, if a country is characterized by an RCA (export) larger than 1, it exports more than the global average. This means that it has acquired capabilities to export sophisticated and technology intensive goods and is competitive on the global stage.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:RCAcap"></span>
<img src="I40_Productivity_files/figure-html/RCAcap-1.png" alt="Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of capital goods" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.2: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of capital goods
</p>
</div>
<p>An interesting picture emerges from the figure above. There are potentially four groups of countries; the first group consists of high-income countries that import relatively fewer capital goods but export relatively more. This means they produce these goods themselves. The second group are developing or transition countries such as Georgia that import relatively few capital goods and also export relatively few. This might point to a lack of capabilities to use those goods and the technology that comes with them. Alternatively, especially larger countries in this group could be producing and using capital goods locally only. The third group, here represented by the Russian Federation, shows an import RCA above one but an export RCA close to zero. This means they import capital goods but are not export them relative to the world average. The fourth group, here represented by Viet Nam and China, imports and exports relatively many capital goods. Viet Nam is an interesting example as it is the only country in this subset that transitioned from being similar to Georgia (group two) to being similar to China.</p>
<p>On the basis of the indicators shown we can create a classification of the following sort.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>RCA import</th>
<th>RCA export</th>
<th>Group</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>&lt; 1</td>
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>&gt; 1</td>
<td>“Emerging”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>&lt; 1</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here, a ‘leader’ is a country with an import RCA of below (or close to) and an export RCA greater than one. These countries have a revealed comparative advantage in exporting goods (but not in importing) and are typically the ones closest to the technology frontier.
Next up we have the ‘emerging’ economies which have a comparative advantage in both importing and in exporting. Here it is important to emphasise that, despite the fact that they have an import and export RCA greater than one, most likely ‘emerging’ economies do not import the same set of goods as they export. This means that if we identify a country as a ‘distributor’ for, say, capital goods, it makes sense to ‘dig deeper’ and look at what kind of capital goods the country imports and exports. Most likely this is where we will be able to identify some differences: A country may be a strong exporter for some groups of goods, while it may still be a follower when it comes to the adoption of the latest available technology. We can see this through the analysis of RCAs of industry 4.0 goods.
The third group, which we define as ‘followers’, are countries with an import RCA bigger than one and an export RCA smaller than one. These are the countries that typically try to adopt new technology through imports and absorption.
Lastly, with both RCAs below one (and typically very low) or missing, we find the group of ‘non-adopter (yet)s’. These countries do not engage in the adoption or dispersion of these goods in any traceable way.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies</h2>
<p>While the numbers above concerned all capital goods, we now focus on 4.0 (ready) goods, such as goods related to additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM or robotics which are part of the ‘smart factory’.
The following graph (Figure <a href="adoption.html#fig:imp-shares">5.3</a>) shows the share imports of 4.0 goods in total imports (in percent). First, the worldwide numbers are remarkably stable over time. During the first decade of the century, the Russian Federation, China and Viet Nam decreased their relative imports of 4.0 goods. With the exception of China, the rest of the subset increased their relative imports, albeit very slowly. The Russian Federation reached their 2002 level again in 2017 with slightly less than 0.6 percent of imports being 4.0 goods.</p>

<p>This insight may allow us to conclude thatsome countries do not yet import capital goods or 4.0 goods, while some others are importing industry 4.0 technology but have not yet moved into a leading position in these technlologies which would allow them to also engage actively in exporting. Again, some others are on the way of adopting these technology, and another group of countries are technology leaders and main exporters of 4.0 goods. These first indicators provide the policy maker with an overview of a country and comparison with other countries on where they stand in terms of overall technology adoption and absorption by looking at trade patterns of capital goods as well as 4.0-ready goods.</p>
</div>
<div id="diff40" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Adoption dynamics within the industry 4.0-ready goods</h2>
<p>We just saw that, e.g. Japan is a leader in technology. In order know if Japans success is based on a single technology or more evenly spread, we cann distinguish different goods. Based on chapter <a href="#ch:advI4"><strong>??</strong></a>, we differentiat between goods classified as additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM and (other) Robotics. Figure <a href="adoption.html#fig:impdiff">5.5</a> shows again the share of imports (in percent) of total imports of a country.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:impdiff"></span>
<img src="I40_Productivity_files/figure-html/impdiff-1.png" alt="Import share (%) in total imports" width="864" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.5: Import share (%) in total imports
</p>
</div>
<p>The first observation is that import shares are very low across countries with a maximum of around 0.4 percent in 2017. This might not be surprising as these goods are among the newest generation of technological capital goods. What is a bit surprising, on the other hand, is that countries show an overall declining or stagnant share of imports in additive manufacturing or CAD-CAM. What is more, the relative position of countries did not change from the more aggregate goods above. This pattern changes, however, when we look at Robotics where shares of imports of robots in total imports are increasing for the most part.</p>
<p>Additionally to study RCA as above, we can also asses the economic importance of these imports when we compare them to a country’s production (indicator XX). Figure <a href="adoption.html#fig:imp40diffGDP">5.6</a> presents imports in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). This way we can see that, e.g., Viet Nam is in the group of ‘emerging’ economies and followers when it comes to imports of goods in total imports, but relative to their overall production, they import much more 4.0-ready goods than the other countries in this sample. Relating imports to a country’s production can thus help give more context to import shares and indicate which goods or technologies are important numerically.</p>

<p>This chapter provided the policy maker with a set of indicators that have to be used in conjunction in order to understand technology adoption patterns. We combine import shares to see the importance of a (group of) good(s) and their potential to help in the adoption with RCA of imports and exports to classify countries into leaders or followers. Disaggregating the data can highlight if a country specializes in particular goods or technologies or if it lacks some of them completely. This can help the policy maker identify potential strengths and weaknesses in the adoption process and points to areas of potential policy interventions.</p>
