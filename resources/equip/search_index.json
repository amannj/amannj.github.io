["advocacy-and-concepts.html", "Section 2 Advocacy and concepts 2.1 Advocacy 2.2 Concepts", " Section 2 Advocacy and concepts 2.1 Advocacy 2.1.1 Industry 4.0: Distinctive in nature, yet part of a long history of technological change. The concept of industry 4.0 boosts the idea of breakthrough technologies which are rapidly penetrating the international market scenario. It is true that the business environment and the production process of the more recent times are rapidly changing and becoming increasingly fast-paced: Exemplarily, maintenance is now progressively governed by powerful algorithms which can predict when and where to replace materials in a firm’s production process and react instantaneously and accordingly. Similarly, humans are increasingly rather supervisors of production processes than manual executors of operations. Despite its often times argued disruptive nature, there are good reasons to assume that industry 4.0 is itself part of a long history of waves of technological change. This is true as all the technologies associated with their respective revolutionary waves in the past were considered to be of a destructive nature: Beginning in the late 18th century with the advent of steam power and the invention of the power loom, the first industrial revolution ushered in mechanization and radically changed how goods were manufactured. In the late 19th century, electricity and assembly lines made mass production possible, giving rise to the second revolution. Many cite the third revolution as beginning in the 1970s, when advances in computing enabled pre-programmed machines and networks and thereby empowering automation. The fourth industrial revolution is set out to take what was started during the third wave a step further, with the adoption of computers and automation enhanced by smart and autonomous systems which are fuelled by big data and complex artificial learning algorithms. Digitally connected manufacturing, often referred to as “industry 4.0”, encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from 3D printing to robotics, new materials, as well as biotechnology and smart production systems. The definition of industry 4.0 adopted in the present module is anchored in digitalization concepts and includes physical and digital technologies such as analytics, artificial intelligence, cognitive technologies and the internet of things (IoT) alike. This new wave of technological innovations, which is characterized by the integration of digital connectivity and advanced technologies, gives rise to automated industrial systems and smart production processes that boost efficiency across economic activities and will inevitably reshape the face of the manufacturing sector as we know it. 2.1.2 Beating the buzzer: The slow uptake of industry 4.0 technologies in developing countries despite its high policy relevance. Each industrial revolution marks a major turning point in the shift of technological, socio-economic and cultural conditions. Waves of technological change and paradigm shifts, driven by the surge of scientific discoveries, have followed one another in accelerated succession. Since then the developmental lag between pure science and engineering application has progressively shortened. Because accumulated technological and productive capabilities of countries differ, a ‘role model’ of successful adoption which would suite all countries does not exist; nor is there a one-size-fits-all policy solution in responding to challenges and opportunities (Lee and Malerba 2017; Dominguez Lacasa et al. 2019). At the same time, the expectation of what the new wave of technological innovation could potentially bring to the table for the developing as well as developed world are at least twofold: For developed countries, industry 4.0 could be a way to regain manufacturing competitiveness. As for developing countries, industry 4.0 could provide the much-needed route to moving up the value chain, something that has become increasingly important to achieve in the face of rising labour costs. However, the creation and diffusion of newly emerging technologies remain extremely concentrated at the world level; though some emerging economies are timidly entering into the new technologies: For emerging technologies such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM), robotics or additive manufacturing, it is documented that less than 10 countries explain 85% of all triadic patents while 77% of all exports are directly associated with these technologies (see Appendix A). At the same time, 84 countries remain excluded from the global creation and use of these technologies (Foster-McGregor, Nomaler &amp; Verspagen, 2019; Lavopa, 2019). In a recent study, Santiago (2019) illustrates that most of the highly industrialized countries have paved their ways accelerating the economic transformation to embrace Industry 4.0. The author documents that at least 9 industrializing countries have announced national strategies around advanced manufacturing, a diversity of approaches, including industrial policies or science, technology and innovation plans, or standalone feasibility studies. Regarding developing countries, several middle-income economies, like the BRICS members, are already adopting smart manufacturing and are even entering areas traditionally reserved for highly industrialized countries (Daudt and Willcox 2016; López-Gómez et al. 2017). For instance, China is adopting industrial development strategies that seek to capitalize on new windows of opportunity where it can benefit from its increasing ability to produce new technologies: Its search for value addition and enhanced technological content is superseding traditional cost advantage strategies (Li 2017; The Economist 2015). Apart from large developing countries, only a handful of smaller counterparts have defined or are in the process of developing strategic policy agendas around smart manufacturing; something which is rarely observed for the group of the least developed economies. For countries willing to adopt new technologies, a minimum base of industrial capabilities is required. Lavopa (2019) shows a clear positive relationship between the adoption roles across different countries; both in terms of innovators, producers as well as, more generally, when it comes to the utilization of technologies associated with the 4th industrial revolution and their average set of industrial capabilities. Similarly, Andreoni and Anzolin (2019) have identified five categories of challenges which explain the gap between developing and developed countries when it comes to their engagement with industry 4.0 technologies and encompass areas such as basic capabilities, retrofitting and integration, digital infrastructure, digital capability gap as well as access and affordability. 2.1.3 Learning through adoption: Imports as the key channel of industry 4.0 technology adoption. Adoption and diffusion of technology across the ecosystem are fundamental steps to capitalize on the window of opportunity of industry 4.0. The experiences of some of the most successful manufacturing firms in East Asia suggest that learning is not possible without adoption. There, most of these successful firms were documented to have started with the adoption of foreign technology for production first and then learned from using and finally enhanced further productivity by mastering these technologies (Lee, 2019). For instance, South Korea and Taiwan followed in the footsteps of an early industrialiser, Japan. Similar episodes of imitate-to-innovate have also fuelled the successful emulation of new production processes and products in China. From latecomers to followers, benchmarking adoption is crucial. A key concern of today’s latecomers is whether they have invested enough resources at the national level as part of the adoption process of new technology in order to turn into a successful follower and, if not, how far they fall behind. An important insight from the historical experience is that latecomers do not necessarily have to become original inventors of new technologies themselves. Rather, taking small, well-informed steps to test technological and policy options according to the goals desired, has proved to be the preferred strategy before fully committing to the implementation of the policy tool at hand. Building on this rationale, the main entry point to a successful adoption of industry 4.0 technologies among developing countries could either be that of a fast-paced adoption process of the emerging technologies or a more adaptive response to the local circumstances through incremental, follow-on innovations with distinct twists. In either case, the import of industry 4.0 goods1 can be an indicator of adoption of technological change for developing countries. 2.1.4 The view ahead: What to expect from industry 4.0 in the medium and long run? Impacts of industry 4.0 on productivity and employment as a key concept in the debate. Any kind of innovation will only gain a foothold if it is beneficial for the firm to adopt the new technologies, i.e. if the newly available technologies result in an improvement of the production processes by making them more productive. These fundamentals are as true for any previously adopted technology as they are in the context of the most recent wave of technological advancements: When countries plan their strategies for industry 4.0, their expectation is an increase of productivity in the production process while ideally preserving if not by increasing jobs through the opening of new markets. The traditional neoclassical growth accounting method has been the standard method in the literature to estimate the contributions of technological change and capital upgrading to output growth. There, productivity gains in terms of production factors are typically described to stem from (a) a process of capital deepening, i.e. a more extensive use of machinery relative to manual labour; as well as (b) an increase in productivity (defined as the ratio of value added created per employee in the production process). In most of the developing countries, the improvement in productivity is a result of the growth in capital stock – more machines replacing the mass of low skilled workers. On the other hand, increases of total factor productivity, i.e. technology growth as a result of the implementation of new technologies, is more apparent in developed countries. Without a further decomposition, expected impacts as seen in productivity may vary from the effect of capital deepening as opposed to the increase in capital per worker to the effect of pure technology growth. In this sense, productivity is an imperfect proxy of impact of technological change, yet its analysis allows one to derive important insights as far as the dynamics of production processes is concerned. The reason this tool puts particular emphasis on the role of productivity as opposed to capital deepening is threefold: First of all, productivity allows one to capture the ‘learning effect’ associated with the adoption of new technology, e.g. through the more efficient handling of new machinery over time. Secondly, obtaining concise measurement on capital stocks across industries is an advanced and rather technical exercise probably more suited for a more academic discussion and would certainly miss the scope and objective of EQuIP. Lastly, and most importantly, the concept of productivity is closely linked to two variables of high policy relevance: The measure of performance (value added) and reciprocity (employment) of an industry. It is at the core of the second tier (on technology absorption and productivity) of this tool to provide guidance on how productivity growth can be reconciled with the objective of increases in performance and reciprocity. The central question linking the concept of industry 4.0 adoption and productivity growth are: What can we learn from past waves of technological change? Can past technological change tell us something about industry 4.0 adoption? On the one hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies can be monitored year by year through opportune indicators. The preparedness for the possible impacts of industry 4.0 adoption on productivity and employment in different industries becomes a key element in anticipating possible responses to the adoption of industry 4.0. In that sense, no one can antedate what will be the consequences of industry 4.0 technology adoption; however, at least one can learn by analysing data from past waves of technological change. This is because the previous waves of technological innovations have been observed through the same productivity transmission channels as the most recent wave related to industry 4.0; and also has their adoption rate been determined by the degree to which they have facilitated an improvement in the production capacity across industries. Based on these insights, the following propositions can be derived: Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all countries. The effects of the most recent wave of technological innovation will vary greatly across industries: Even though industry 4.0 will affect all countries and industries, the degree may differ substantially. Exemplarily, there is no reason to believe that industry 4.0 should only affect either high income countries or particular industries. Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all industrial sectors. As with all previous industrialization waves, different countries adopt different strategies at different periods of time. Not because they were necessarily ‘too late’ but rather because their industrial composition demands a different policy approach than that of other countries. Technological change is not always reflected in a simultaneous increase of manufacturing value added, productivity and employment, but it often generates trade-off. Some industries might have retained a productivity profile that is highly favourable for the economic development of the country in question. This, however, does not imply that the same approach would work for any other country. 2.1.5 The impact of industry 4.0 on employment: different mechanisms at play, uncertain outcome. The concern of technological unemployment and will this time be different? In the economic development landscape today, certain milestones of productive capacities have become ever more complex: The labour forces in most of the economies are no longer dominated by undifferentiated mass of unskilled workers but characterized by workers with a dynamic skills portfolio. Consequently, the effects of automation can be counterbalanced by the creation of new complex tasks in which labour has comparative advantage1; even more so if skill-enabling technology is introduced. Such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - they reinstate labour into a broader range of tasks through reskilling and upskilling (Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo, 2019). Automation replaces repetitive tasks and creates new, more complex tasks. Tasks previously performed by labour are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement labour, known as the labour augmenting effect. “The difference between human labour and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not.” (Leontief, 1958). Automation directly takes jobs away from unskilled labour who specialize in routine and repetitive tasks and new tasks tend to benefit skilled workers. This process increases social inequality in the short run, however, the standardization of new tasks over time tends to help low-skill workers to handle more complex tasks. To this extent, both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality in the short run, but it also presents the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run (Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo, 2017). The demands on employment and skills brought about by the fourth industrial revolution highlight the human capital as a key enabler to industrial development, where insufficient exposure to high-technology jobs can hinder the ability to adapt and respond to the disruptive changes expected from the industry 4.0 (WEF, 2017; Kraemer-Mbula, 2019). Heterogeneous employment effects across types of jobs and industries are to be expected. Because manufacturing industries are characterized by different structures of labour-capital composition, it is likely the impact of automation on manufacturing which differs across industries. Moreover, different technologies are accompanied by productivity effects of varying magnitudes, and, hence, one set of automation technologies will not impact labour demand in the same way as others. As a matter of fact, there are multiple industries that can enjoy productivity dividends while enjoying employment generation; either because new production processes require manual input at different points of the production process (Autor, 2015) or because only particular tasks of an employee’s job description have been ‘rationalized away’ (Arntz, 2016).2 Effective local and global demand may preserve both jobs and social well-being. In the context of manufacturing, the threat to employment is that as creative destruction unfolds, the destructive part is expected to fall primarily on industries with robot-based automation (Mayer, 2018). Rapid technological change has halved the price of industrial robots between 1990 and 2005 (Graetz and Michaels, 2016), this further catalyses the automation process in certain industries leading to potential jobless growth dynamics. On a positive note, economic policies could affect the impact of automation on aggregate demand. If productivity gains are shared and real wages grow in line with productivity growth, automation will tend to boost private consumption, aggregate demand and ultimately total employment. Obviously, in such cases, an important role is played by macro-prudential policies that operate to sustain effective demand, employment and standards of living within a country. Even if that is not the case, for some countries, employment could remain stable or even increase if the additional supply that results from automation-based productivity growth is absorbed through increased demand from exports. Robots boost companies’ international cost competitiveness, which may in turn spur exports and thereby make other countries bear at least part of the adverse consequences from robot-based automation through reduced output and employment opportunities. 2.2 Concepts In many countries there are great expectations regarding the potential of the latest wave of the digital technology evolution (also referred to as industry 4.0 throughout this tool) and its effect on the economy. International organisations such as the World Bank, the OECD as well as UNIDO have devoted large part of their resources to provide a better understanding on how these new technologies may reshape our economies; see Box X for more information. For the purpose of this EQuIP module, we take a close look at the effect of industry 4.0 and the adoption of new technologies on the manufacturing sector. While this of course only allows us to cover parts of the effect the adoption of new, digital technologies, we provide a very clear and granular focus on the manufacturing industries and developing countries in particular. While this differentiates our efforts from other studies on this topic, we want to point out that the analysis conducted in this tool should be seen as a complementing rather than a holistic analysis on new technologies. place holder: info box on OECD etc. research When considering the effect of technological revolutions on manufacturing processes, it is important to understand that technological evolution is hardly a one-way street. Rather is is an important and interconnected part of a modern economy. Figure 2.1 illustrates this point: New technologies (such as industry 4.0) will only really be adopted into the production processes of an economy, if there is something to be gained from it. These potential gains could be manifold3 but typically always also effect the efficiency of a production process: If new technologies are allowing a company to produce more output with the same amount of input, they are eager to adopt this technology. If these technologies are adopted by many/all firms of country, their productivity gains reach macro-economic dimensions, and macro-prudential indicators will reflect the changes in the production dynamics which are the result of the newly adopted technology.4 Figure 2.1: Visualisation of concept. On the other hand, new technology is rarely something that falls from the heavens. It is well understood that research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures are a great indicator of the success of a company: If a company tries to research how new technologies may improve their own production processes, this will not only set the company apart from less R&amp;D-engaged competitors but also result in the creation of new technology as a whole. In this sense, the pursuit of productivity growth also leads to the development of new technologies. It should become clear from this, that dimensions of ‘adoption of new technologies’ and ‘productivity’ are two sides of the same coin and should always be considered together. It goes without saying that the connection between the adoption of new technologies and productivity growth is a very complex question. As illustrated in Figure 2.1, what glues these two domains together are the right capabilities and preconditions that are needed to allow for a successful communication of both domains. Because of the importance of this insight, a complete EQuIP tool (Tool 9: Industrial capability indicators) is dedicated to shed light on all the relevant dimensions that are needed to provide the right starting conditions for robust economic growth within - but not exclusive to - manufacturing. In the remainder of this section we move on to provide a clear conceptual framework on what is meant by industry 4.0 and how it is integrated with digital manufacturing technologies with particular focus on developing countries. We then move on to discuss a way to measure and identify different kinds of productivity growth dynamics. 2.2.1 Industry 4.0 2.2.1.1 Adoption of new technologies in manufacturing Within the policy debate, many countries are orienting their industrial strategies and policies towards the adoption of technologies associated with the fourth wave of industrial innovation in the hopes that these new technologies can boost economic performance through increased productivity and by opening new markets. The focus of this tool is in the intersection of the latest technology emerging in the digital and production technology and manufacturing production process. We refer to this domain as the smart factory which is populated by a very particular set of production technologies and concepts; see Figure 2.2 for more information. Figure 2.2: New technologies and advanced manufacturing. At the same time it is important to recognise that digital technologies have had a long and successful past within the domain of manufacturing already and are not limited to the latest wave of digital technology.This is important to note: Industry 4.0 refers to some particular types of digital technology but not to all digital technology. This point is illustrated in Figure 2.3 and shows a progression from analog production towards smart, digital technologies: Starting from analogue production, processes have become more integrated while also having moved from partial use of digital and ICT technologies.5 What is particularly important here is that Figure 2.3 also allows us to identify a particular set of very narrowly defined concepts which can be related to (a) particular stage(s) of the digital technology pyramid. For example the domain of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing is most closely related to the smart factory stage. This is because for the large-scale production of goods through 3D printing, very specific and newly developed materials are required which belong to the technological frontier ( Figure 2.2). CAD-CAM technologies6 on the other hand allow for a large-scale of computer aided production process within manufacturing but a fully integrated logistical or digital network across areas is not required. Lastly, robots govern by fare the broadest domain of digital technologies. This is true as (simple) robots can be used to fulfil very rudimentary tasks with little to no complexity in rigid production process; however (smart) robots also form a central building block for smart factories. It is because of this complexity that we will pay very close attention to the adoption of robots and robot technology in one of the later parts of this tool. Figure 2.3: Production technologies in manufacturing. Questions for Nico: Should we add an info box pointing at all the categories as defined in the IDR questionnaire? Should we follow up on Alejandro’s suggestion on how to change this figure? Should we provide a narrow definition of what we mean by the the industry 4.0 goods clusters? particularly robots? While these three goods clusters allow us to identify very specific dimension in the adoption of industry 4.0 ready manufacturing technologies, they themselves are part of a much broader group of capital goods; see Figure 2.4. This is an important insight as capital goods are of high relevance for a positive development path of the manufacturing industry CITATION/REFERENCE needed. Therefore, considering the three dimensions in Figure 2.4 jointly, we can empirically evaluate the intensity with which countries govern a particular domain of capital goods and where that would place them relative to global benchmarking cases. Whereas it will not be a surprise if a country which is leading in the development and distribution of additive manufacturing technology will also do well in other industry 4.0 goods, assessing the intensity of a particular developing country will certainly be more informative. Figure 2.4: The family of capital goods. 2.2.1.2 Robots …incomplete… 2.2.2 Productivity The central measure of productivity in this tool is that of labour productivity which is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country. The growth rate of productivity can be approximated by the growth rate of value added generation minus the growth rate of employment as illustrated in the formula below: \\[ growth(Labour~Productivity) = growth(Value~added) - growth(Employment) \\] In simple terms, we will see an increase in productivity (a positive growth rate) if the same number of workers (employment growth of zero) generates more value added, e.g. by producing more goods, (a positive value added growth rate). Conversely, if one requires more employees to produce the same amount of value added, then the measured degree of productivity would have gone down (negative growth). 2.2.2.1 Introducing: runner industries These simple fundamentals can be visualised in Figure 2.5, which illustrates the complex nature of productivity growth dynamics an economy might face: Exemplarily, positive productivity growth can either be brought about by a positive and higher growth of value added over also positive employment growth (also referred to ‘inclusive and tenable growth’ or ‘runner industries’) as well as positive value added and negative employment growth to which we will also refer as ‘jobless growth’. Lastly, positive productivity growth may also be reported if value added growth reduces less than employment growth (‘declining growth’). Figure 2.5: Visualisation of concept. From this it should become clear that not all forms of productivity growth are equally desirable; nor are all forms of a decline in productivity growth equally bad. This classification tool can help policy makers identify the nature of the structural dynamics of industrial sectors and assess as to whether they follow a more or less desirable regime. At the same time, the logical matrix allows to re-assess the classification of particular industries conditional on the time dimension considered: Exemplarily, industry 4.0 adoption in a particular industry might have led to an increase (or decrease) in the demand of employees which was not apparent in the pre-industry 4.0 era for that particular industry. By varying the time dimension of the analysis one can therefore identify and classify the changes of industry-specific dynamics after a set of policy interventions and/or market transformations. 2.2.2.2 Introducing: runner industry exposure At the same time, it is interesting an important for policy makers to know how much of their economy follows a sustainable growth path in employment and productivity. We will capture this dimension through the analysis of runner industry exposure. From the runner industry methodological (See Appendix D for more information) we have seen that high income countries are those characterized by a high share of runners. This finding is crucial for two reasons: It shows that rich countries are those showing the highest share of sectors characterized by inclusive growth, meaning productivity, employment and manufacturing value added enhancing development. Countries which became rich are the ones which were more exposed to an inclusive growth path. This is a very important message: Growth does not necessarily need to pay a toll in terms of growth/employment trade-off. Runner industries include low technology and medium high-technology industries alike. The fact that rich countries are those showing a higher share of runners means that in order to reach a high-income level, countries do not have to bet on medium high-technology industries alone. As mentioned earlier, there are many ways to the heaven and the message here seems to be that inclusive growth and within-industry structural change1 matters as well. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industry 4.0 debate as this latest wave of technological advancement will not create technologies that are exclusively confined to the domain of medium-high technology industry, but rather will also find their way into the lower technology segments. From a policy perspective, the analysis of the share of runners constitutes precious information for policy makers: First of all because the runner industry classification allows policy makers to identify jobless growth dynamics as part of the conceptual toolbox. If the uptake of industry 4.0 will be successful in a particular country (and more generally, if that country will be able to increase its production productivity either through capital deepening or other channels), a low share of runners flags a higher vulnerability to undesirable employment dynamics. In other words, this means that countries are more exposed to industries where inclusive and tenable growth was not achieved. Secondly, identification of such outcomes may call for a special attention of the policy maker potentially leading to an intervention with the aim to preserve inclusive and tenable growth by also considering the country specific characteristics developed in the next section. In this sense the runner industry classification may not only serve as an assessment but also as an early-warning tool in the context of a much wider policy intervention analysis. BOX: oecd and patents Foster-McGregor, Nomaler, and Verspagen (2019) put forward a methodology to identify 4IR patents and traded goods. The focus is placed on four technologies: CAD-CAM, robotics, machine learning and additive manufacturing. Not only do they identify patents that can be associated with the above technologies, but they also look into trade statistics and identify those goods which can be associated with three of the above technologies: CAD-CAM, Robotics and Additive Manufacturing (see Box 1 for detailed HS classification of industry 4.0 goods). The other technologies typically related to the 4IR (such as big data, cloud computing and machine learning) are not considered since the most important part of these technologies is software which they can hardly be found in the trade classification.↩ In the automotive industry, advances in robotic technologies allow manufacturers to gradually automate a series of production tasks since the implantation of the first industrial robot in the 1960s. It does not come as a surprise that routine and repetitive tasks like welding and painting are now attended to by pre-programmed robotic arms without much of human intervention during the production process. It is evident that operative worker can be reskilled and reinstated to handle more complex tasks. For example, previously, inspection related tasks could only be handled by highly trained inspectors. With the aid of robotic vision technology, reskilled workers can now operate the inspection tasks without compromising on the quality. Automation in manufacturing has decreased production costs and reduced the price of manufactured goods. This pushes demand towards larger volume and may create more formal sector jobs. A study shows that about half of employment growth over 1980-2015 took place in occupations where job titles or tasks performed by workers changed (Lin, 2011).↩ Consider for example cleaner production, higher working standards etc↩ For the remainder of this tool the term ‘productivity’ refers to labour productivity as will be defined in the methodology part of this tool. We concede that labour productivity is only one form to capture the efficiency of production processes but we retain our focus on this rather simple variable to retain a straight-forward and - in terms of data coverage - broad measure.↩ Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middle ware, storage, and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate information.

How can we asses if a country’s industrial automation capacity has improved? Robots are used as complements or substitutes for human labour. Instead of using absolute stocks, we define robot intensity as the stock of robots per manufacturing employment. If this number is increasing, more robots are used for the same amount of human labour (or the same number of robots with less humans). \\[ Robot~intensity~within~manufacturing_{i,t} = \\frac{Industrial~robot~operational~stock_{i,t}}{Manufacturing~employment_{i,t}} \\] Table 3.9: Robot intensity in a country Indicator Variable Source Robot intensity within manufacturing Industrial robot operational stock IFR, World Robotics Statistics Manufacturing employment UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Next, we calculate the annual growth rate of the robot intensity. \\[ Annual~growth~rate~of~robot~intensity_{i,t} = \\frac{End~value_{i,t} - Initial~value_{i,t}}{Initial~value_{i,t}} \\] 3.1.3 Risk exposure Strategic questions and data sources To what extent are manufacturing jobs in the country at risk of robot-based automation? In order to see if robot-based automation is a risk to manufacturing employment, in a first step, we want to know how many people are employed in the manufacturing sector and how this relates to a country’s overall economy. \\[ Share~of~employment~at~risk~in~total~manufac._{i,t} = \\frac{Manufac.~employment~in~risk~industries_{i,t}}{Total~manufacturing~employment_{i,t}} \\] \\[ Share~of~manufac.~employment~in~total~employment_{i,t} = \\frac{Total~manufacturing~employment_{i,t}}{Total~employment_{i,t}} \\] Table 3.10: Risk exposure of a country`s manufacturing employment to robot-based automation Indicator Variable Source Share of employment at risk in total manufacturing Manufacturing employment in risk sectors: electronics, automotives and rubber UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Total manufacturing employment UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Share of manufacturing employment in total employment Total manufacturing employment UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Total employment World Bank WDI 3.2 Productivity The analysis of productivity related dynamics is built on two consecutive steps (see 3.11): In a first step the three central variables of the analysis (productivity, employment, value added) are used to analyze industry-level growth dynamics and follow an inclusive and tenable growth trajectory (a positive growth rate of value added, employment and productivity). Throughout the analysis we refer to these industries as ‘runners’ (or runner industries). In a second step, we assess the share of runner industries relative to the manufacturing sector of a country. This way we can quantify the proportion of a country’s manufacturing industry characterized by positive productivity, value added and employment dynamics. Table 3.11: Structure of analysis Indicator Variable Step 1: Identification of inclusive and tenable industry growth Productivity CAGR Employment CAGR Value added CAGR Step 2:Country exposure to inclusive and tenable industry growth Value added share of runner sub-sector Employment share of runner sub-sector 3.2.1 Runner industries Strategic questions and data sources What are the productivity growth dynamics of a particular industry and what do they depend on? Are positive productivity growth rates always good? Are there industries that provide positive growth and employment prospective even during the most recent periods of global market integration and fast-paced technological advancements? The indicators used for this analysis are the sub-sector value added and employment series from UNIDO INDSTAT2 both of which are used to calculate the third indicator (productivity). See ?? Table 3.12: Data Sources for identification of inclusive and tenable industry growth Indicator Variable Source Employment growth rate Sub-sector employment-to-population compound annual growth rate (CAGR) UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Value added growth rate Sub-sector value added per capita (VA) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) UNIDO INDSTAT2 rev.3 Productivity growth rate Sub-sector productivity growth rate (CAGR) (calculated based on variables above) Methodological underpinnings of runner identification analysis The purpose of this step is to illustrate the effect of (changes in) productivity dynamics and how they relate to economy-wide performance patterns. The subsequent analysis is conducted on the basis of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) which is calculated as \\[ CAGR = \\frac{End~value}{Initial~value}^{1/no.~of~years} -1 \\] The CAGR corresponds to a smoothed annual average over the time horizon considered. It serves as a measure to illustrate how much a particular variable has grown over time. In the case of this tool, we are interested in learning about the growth rates of employment, value added as well as productivity: Productivity is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country. Based on this formula one can calculate CAGRs for productivity, value added and employment. As discussed in ??, some combinations of growth rates of these three variables are more desirable than others. In the empirical application (???) we will focus on the set of runner industries. 3.2.2 Runner exposure Strategic questions and data sources What is the exposure of a country to industries that have experienced positive employment, value added and productivity growth in the past? How does the share of these industries evolve over time?

["runners.html", "Section 4 Productivity 4.1 Runner industries 4.2 Runner exposure 4.3 Runner industries: Industry profiling", " Section 4 Productivity It is the goal of this Chapter to provide both a set of tools as well as some answers to this highly complex topic by offering a medium-/long-run view which allows policy makers to put recent (as well as past) technological innovations into perspective. It does so by providing a dynamic classification apparatus which will allow practitioners to identify and evaluate different types of manufacturing growth regimes. Particularly the concept of runner industries puts emphasis on the concept of sustained employment growth; a feature that cannot be overstated in light of the employment automation risk discussed in the context of the newly emerging technologies with smart systems and robots before. The concept of runner industries will also be extended to that of runner industry exposure which provides a simple tool to characterise the share of industries within manufacturing that feature particularly positive characteristics. As will be discussed in due course, the empirical regularity of runner industries is also highly relevant when talking about the fear of jobless growth. Lastly, it is very important to note that the classification of runner industries, is derived from average global trends. Consequently, one should note that the idea of runner industries is not a static concept but fundamentally depends on the set of countries and time periods looked at. We will discuss these implications when talking about individual effects ; see Figure 4.1 for a visual representation of the building blocks of this chapter. Figure 4.1: Structur of Productivity analysis. The subsequent paragraphs offer a comparison of runner industries in the context of Viet Nam. It is illustrated how policy analysts can utilize this tool to understand the role as well as the aim and scope of the runner industry methodology which may potentially result in calls for further investigation of the bottlenecks which induced countries to perform worse and of the success factors to build upon. 4.1 Runner industries We start the empirical analysis by identifying runner industries. Particularly through the adoption of new technologies, the importance of the identification of runner industries (most notably for the very recent periods) cannot be overstated: This set of industries has remained at the forefront of value added and employment generation and therefore stands in stark contrast to the jobless or declining growth types identified. In order to be able to identify the corresponding regime types associated with the respective industry, employment, value added as well as productivity compound annual growth rates (\\(CAGR\\)) are to be calculated using the following steps: Obtain value added and employment data from INDSTAT. Obtain population data from an alternative data source such as the World Development Indicators. Calculate value added per capita as well as the employment-population ratio.7 For the value added series it is further necessary to eliminate any potential price effects in the series (see Appendix B for more details). Calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each of the three variables For the measure of productivity calculate: \\[ Productivity = Value~added~per~capita / Employent~population~ratio \\] Create cross-country/industry average to obtain aggregates of interest. The indicators obtained through this procedure form the basis of the subsequent analysis. Table 4.1 summarises the results for the full data sample and across all countries available through INDSTAT.8 As can be seen, the food and beverages, rubber and plastic as well as fabricated metals, electrical machinery and motor vehicles industries are identified to have a positive employment and productivity growth trend over the full data sample from 1963 to 2017. Table 4.1: Runner industries: all countries over the full sample period.

Considering the full data time span available through INDSTAT may be interesting to learn more about the general trend and dynamics within manufacturing. On the other hand, this approach also has its limitations: First of all, it analyses productivity growth over a very long window of time. At the same time, it creates averages across many countries, some of which may only have data for some earlier or later periods. In this sense, this initial analysis measures for example the the effect of colour TVs in the 1970s together with the digital revolution as well as industry 4.0 together in the more recent past together. This can be both instructive but also misleading as particularly developing countries have much better data coverage for the most recent decades. Consequently, if one would like to learn more about the runner industry trends in the more recent past, say, since 2000, a similar table can be obtained by simply truncating the data. The results are shown in Table 4.2 and show, that positive growth dynamics can be reported for more manufacturing industries: Compared to before, now also the chemicals and precision instruments industries can be classified as runner industries. Table 4.2: Runner industries: all countries over the post sample period.

The above analysis can also be conducted for other sub-samples. Table ?? provides a list of other potentially relevant sub-samples. This tables shows that there are a great number of runner industries for lower income countries in the post-2000s where positive employment and productivity growth has been achieved despite the most recent technological developments. At the same time, high income countries which naturally are at a different stage in industrial development than emerging countries, are the ones with the smallest number of runner industries identified. Lastly, Table ?? also shows that runner industries are typically identified to be on average part of the medium- and high-technology group. However, it is important that this is not the result of some fixed classification (as that of technology groups for example), but purely the result of the growth dynamics of value added and employment: If an industry follows these favourable growth dynamics, then it will also qualify as a runner industry. This can be seen for the food end beverages industry which, despite being considered a low-technology industry, also belongs to the set of runner industries in most of the cases. The latter is an important insight regarding future development as well: It could be possible, that new technologies will allow an industry that is currently low-technology, to become more technologically sophisticated in the future. If this goes hand in hand with an expansion of the industry (through value added and employment growth), we will also be able to identify it as a runner industry. In this sense, the runner industry classification is capable of also this kind of dynamism which we refer to as intra-industry upgrading; see E for more information. Table 4.3: Summary of runner industries classification by aggregate Full sample Post-200 High income, full sample Lower income, full sample Lower income, post-2000 15 15 15 24 24 24 25 25 25 28 28 28 28 28 31A 31A 31A 31A 33 33 34A 34A 34A 34A 36 36 36 Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, Lower income = low and lower middle income countries according to World Bank (2019) classification. 4.2 Runner exposure In the previous step we discussed ways to measure the performance of manufacturing industries along the delineating lines of productivity, value added and employment. We saw how this kind of analysis is sensible to the choice of country comparators and time dimensions. It also highlighted the importance of assessing an industry performance in the context of the variation across countries. While this may serve as an important step to learn about the dynamics of a particular (set of) industry(ies) of a country, it says very little about the characteristics of the manufacturing industry of a particular country as a whole. Consequently, and in order to assess the degree to which a country’s manufacturing sector is comprised of industries with inclusive and tenable growth dynamics (runner industries), a simple ratio of runner industries in total manufacturing is proposed. In this way we can obtain two simple indicators that allow us to assess the share of manufacturing industries in an economy that have experienced inclusive and sustained growth in the past. If, for example, the share of runner industries in total manufacturing of a country is very low, this indicates higher risk of jobless growth in the wake of technological adoptions which would deserve attention from the policy makers especially in terms of measures for employment protection. We have also seen in previous sections that in the long term a higher and prolonged exposure towards sectors which on average are not the best performers in terms of jobs creation may be associated to lower income levels. What is more, the concept of runner exposure may be useful not only in order to summarize the performance of one particular country, it can also be used to produce country rankings based on either the runner share in total manufacturing value added or employment, respectively: Table 4.4 ranks the countries with regards to their exposure to post-2000 runner industries for the year 2016 by runner value added and employment share in descending order. What becomes apparent is that out of the top-10 countries eight belong the group of high-income countries while Viet Nam ranks 42nd out of 57 in terms of value added runner shares. In other words, 54 percent of value added contribution (33 percent of employment contribution) to total manufacturing value added (employment) in 2016 has come from industries that have reported positive value added and employment growth rate in the post-2000 period. This puts Viet Nam into the 18 percentile of ranked countries in terms of value added generation (2nd percentile for employment).9 Table 4.4: Exposure to runner industry ranking, year 2016, post-2000 runners, sorted by runner value added and employment share in descending order. Ranking Country Runner value added share Runner employment share Income group 1 Switzerland 0.89 0.82 High income 2 Luxembourg 0.87 0.90 High income 4 Germany 0.80 0.79 High income 6 France 0.79 0.79 High income 7 Philippines 0.78 0.66 Lower middle income 8 Hungary 0.77 0.74 High income 9 Netherlands 0.76 0.77 High income 12 Colombia 0.74 0.63 Upper middle income 13 Croatia 0.74 0.65 High income 35 Bulgaria 0.62 0.57 Upper middle income 42 Viet Nam 0.54 0.33 Lower middle income 44 Mongolia 0.51 0.42 Lower middle income Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2000-2017, runner exposure shares shown for year 2016. When narrowing down the analysis of runner exposure to the set of lower middle income countries, 4.5 indicates that Viet Nam ranks 6th out of 10 for all lower middle income countries for the runner value added shares. At the same time, Viet Nam’s runner employment share is the second lowest for the set of lower middle-income countries. It is particularly this observation that merits further discussion: This is because so far we have benchmarked Viet Nam against a group of countries that share the same income group. This, however, does not necessarily imply that they also automatically follow the same industrial strategy and/or industry composition. We will discuss these point in the next section. Table 4.5: Exposure to runner industry ranking for lower middle-income countries, year 2016, post-2000 runners, sorted by runner value added and employment share in descending order. Ranking Country Runner value added share Runner employment share Income group 7 Philippines 0.78 0.66 Lower middle income 20 Egypt 0.69 0.53 Lower middle income 21 Indonesia 0.69 0.48 Lower middle income 32 Ukraine 0.64 0.62 Lower middle income 40 Republic of Moldova 0.58 0.57 Lower middle income 42 Viet Nam 0.54 0.33 Lower middle income 44 Mongolia 0.51 0.42 Lower middle income 46 Sri Lanka 0.50 0.36 Lower middle income 47 India 0.47 0.50 Lower middle income 57 Kyrgyzstan 0.17 0.50 Lower middle income Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2000-2017, runner exposure shares shown for year 2016. 4.3 Runner industries: Industry profiling It is important to note that the idea of runner industries is not a static concept. It fundamentally depends on the set of countries and time periods looked at. In other words, even though one industry follows a declining growth trend on the global average, this does not imply that this will have negative value added and employment growth dynamics for all countries and regions. In the same vein, the observation that another industry has shown inclusive and tenable growth characteristics on the global scale does not imply that this industry must be equally successful across all countries considered. One last observation with regards to the dimension of the runner industry analysis is that its identification is not only sensitive to the choice of time dimension but also depends on the choice of the country sample. In this regard it may not be a sensible strategy for a developing country to identify and/or advocate for the development of runner industries as identified either on the global stage or, more specifically, with regards to a sub-set of advanced economies. We have seen this point before when talking about the runner share exposure of Viet Nam vis-a-vis other lower middle income countries. 4.3.1 Variation across countries Having identified a successful runner industry in the aggregate does not imply that this industry will be equally successful across all countries. For example, when applying the runner analysis concept to the full sample of available economies, out of the 18 industries, 5 follow an inclusive and sustained value added and employment growth while another 7 display jobless growth characteristics on the global stage (see Table 4.1). On the other hand, when we focus the analysis on Viet Nam in particular and contrast this with the development of lower middle income economies, we can obtain a much more narrow and precise industry performance profile of the Vietnamese manufacturing sector (see Table 4.6). Exemplarily, whereas the wearing apparel industry has been following a declining growth trajectory (where positive productivity growth is a consequence of an even stronger decrease in employment growth than value added growth) on the global scale, it has been of a jobless growth nature for the case of lower middle income countries. At the same time, the Vietnamese wearing apparel industry has both enjoyed a robust growth in productivity and employment. This analysis indicates that the Vietnamese wearing apparel industry has followed a very different trend to that of the global average and/or that of its lower middle-income counterparts. In other cases, such as for example the motor vehicles industry, Viet Nam has enjoyed inclusive and tenable growth dynamics similar to those of its lower middle-income counterparts, and the global economy alike. Table 4.6: Viet Nam vs. lower middle-income countries, full sample period Manufacturing industry Viet Nam Productivity CAGR Viet Nam VA CAGR Viet Nam Employment CAGR Lower income counties productivity CAGR Lower income counties VA CAGR Lower income counties Employment CAGR 15: Food and beverages 1.92 3.71 1.76 1.88 1.83 -0.19 16: Tobacco -3.86 -5.87 -2.09 3.82 0.94 -2.72 17: Textiles -2.80 0.17 3.05 0.39 -2.15 -2.85 18A: Wearing apparel 2.57 9.99 7.24 3.67 3.40 -0.47 20: Wood products NA NA NA 0.91 -0.83 -1.68 21: Paper 3.58 7.42 3.71 2.96 4.06 -0.51 22: Printing and publishing NA NA NA 1.51 0.34 -1.77 23: Coke and refined petroleum NA NA NA 1.28 0.24 -1.02 24: Chemicals -0.48 5.27 5.77 1.53 2.44 0.78 25: Rubber and plastic -1.08 6.62 7.78 -0.06 3.00 2.19 26: Minerals -0.67 0.07 0.74 2.32 2.23 -0.45 27: Basic metals 8.61 15.08 5.96 3.38 2.58 -0.73 28: Fabricated metals -5.24 0.49 6.04 2.40 2.11 0.01 29C: Machinery NA NA NA 0.31 -1.61 -3.31 31A: Electrical machinery NA NA NA 0.80 3.84 4.82 33: Precision instruments NA NA NA 10.88 4.19 -5.62 34A: Motor vehicles 4.50 9.50 4.78 2.11 4.57 2.68 36: Furniture, n.e.c -5.59 -0.64 5.24 0.85 1.52 1.11 Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 1963-2017. Another important point when it comes to identifying runner industries is to note that even if an industry is identified to follow an inclusive and sustained growth trajectory, i.e. has positive productivity and employment growth, on average, this does not imply that one can expect such dynamics to hold true for all countries considered in the analysis. This result is highlighted in Figure 4.2 which shows a simple histogram for the productivity, value added and employment CAGRs: This visual tool is helpful in illustrating how different the growth rates across the set of countries considered for the analysis is. Figure 4.2: CAGR distribution food and beverages. The red vertical lines identify the average growth rates for each of the three variables. Additionally, the three CAGRs for Viet Nam are highlighted in dark blue. This illustration serves two main purposes: First of all, it allows one to examine if the average growth rates are driven by some extreme (either very high or very low) growth rate or if they are representative of sector dynamics.10 In the case presented here we see that the histogram seems to be somewhat positively skewed. This means that the right tail of the distribution (the right side of the histogram) is longer (has more higher values) than the left.11 In other words, there are a few countries reporting considerably higher growth rates for productivity, value added and employment. At the same time, the highest number of countries report productivity (value added) growth rates of roughly +2 (+1) percent and -0.5 percent for employment as illustrated by the peak of the histogram count. Secondly, by comparing the histogram and average with the recorded growth rates for Viet Nam (dark blue bar in Figure 4.2), one can easily and quickly compare Viet Nam’s growth performance relative to that of other countries: Whereas Viet Nam’s productivity growth rate appears to be in line with that of the majority of economies compared here, its value added and employment growth rates belong to the highest in the sample. This result again illustrates the importance of considering the productivity dynamics alongside that of its composing factors as a similar productivity growth rate could have also been achieved by a lower value added and potentially negative employment growth rate as the case of the lower middle income countries in Table 4.6 has illustrated. 4.3.2 Temporal variation. Te point on temporal variation is illustrated by considering the analysis for the post-2000 period which corresponds to most recent period of fast-paced industry 4.0 adoption across the globe only. Looking at Table 16 which compares Viet Nam in the post-2000 era a few points can be made: First of all, the results for Viet Nam in Table 16 are identical to those in Table 15. This is because of the fact that the real value added series for any industry does not start before 2000. This is an important insight when defining the sample for the analysis which might change depending on the policy question to be answered: If one wants to analyse the most recent trends across a set of neighbouring economies, a different data sample would be selected as if one was interested in the global performance of a particular industry since the financial crisis in 2007/2008. Again, in other cases, for example if one wants to analyse the performance of the food and beverage industry between 1970 and 1985, data limitations might render this an infeasible exercise; as is the case for Viet Nam here. At the same time, Table 16 indicates that the food and beverage industry can, on average, be characterized as a runner industry in the post-2000 era for the set of lower middle income countries. The result is brought about by the average employment growth rate to switch sign from negative to positive (see Table 19 and Table 20). As part of an exploratory data analysis one may be inclined to try to identify where the differences in average growth rates may come from. Are these the results of some extreme observations (outliers) or do they reflect a gradual change in the economies of the food and beverage industry of lower middle-income countries? Table 4.7: Viet Nam vs. lower middle-income countries, full sample period Manufacturing industry Viet Nam Productivity CAGR Viet Nam VA CAGR Viet Nam Employment CAGR Lower income counties productivity CAGR Lower income counties VA CAGR Lower income counties Employment CAGR 15: Food and beverages 1.92 3.71 1.76 1.75 2.36 0.38 16: Tobacco -3.86 -5.87 -2.09 4.87 1.32 -3.40 17: Textiles -2.80 0.17 3.05 0.40 -2.30 -2.87 18A: Wearing apparel 2.57 9.99 7.24 3.05 3.11 -0.10 20: Wood products NA NA NA 1.41 0.44 -1.09 21: Paper 3.58 7.42 3.71 2.20 3.64 -0.33 22: Printing and publishing NA NA NA 2.11 0.64 -1.91 23: Coke and refined petroleum NA NA NA -5.10 -4.37 0.73 24: Chemicals -0.48 5.27 5.77 0.96 2.60 1.32 25: Rubber and plastic -1.08 6.62 7.78 -0.62 2.97 2.57 26: Minerals -0.67 0.07 0.74 2.94 3.64 -0.36 27: Basic metals 8.61 15.08 5.96 2.84 2.24 -0.31 28: Fabricated metals -5.24 0.49 6.04 0.46 1.87 0.72 29C: Machinery NA NA NA -1.08 -3.16 -3.57 31A: Electrical machinery NA NA NA 1.96 4.16 3.79 33: Precision instruments NA NA NA 8.13 5.31 -1.41 34A: Motor vehicles 4.50 9.50 4.78 1.97 4.39 2.60 36: Furniture, n.e.c -5.59 -0.64 5.24 0.54 1.55 1.37 Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2010-2017. As can be seen in the distribution of growth rates for the full and post-2000 regime, it becomes obvious that Viet Nam’s employment growth has been comparatively high relative to historic standards (right panel). On the other hand, the upper panel of Figure 4.3 illustrates that employment growth rates like the one reported by Viet Nam are much more frequent amongst the group of lower middle income countries in the post-2000 era. As a matter of fact, it appears as if the distribution of employment growth rates has become much more bi-polar over the last two decades. Figure 4.3: CAGR distribution food and beverages. To conclude, in this section we have applied the concept of runner industries to identify growth dynamics. We follow the example of the Vietnamese manufacturing industries and related them to more general dynamics observed amongst the set of lower middle-income countries. The analysis has further highlighted the fact that the concept of runner industries is a relative concept and therefore sensitive to the choice of data sample. Whereas this certainly makes the concept of runner industries a challenging tool to apply, it also constitutes its biggest advantage over more static classification tools: Following the notion that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to manufacturing policy in general and technology adoption in particular, the tool of runner industries allows for a flexible identification of growth enhancing (in the context of value added and employment creation) identification and classification of industries which can be tailored and streamlined to follow the particular assessment needs of policy makers. At the same time, this tool has also highlighted that even within a narrowly defined window of analysis, differences in the respective growth rates are reflective of country-specific effects and should therefore be given close consideration during the interpretation stage of the runner industry assessment. For a careful consideration of the runner industry classification in the case of Viet Nam it is important to contextualize the differences identified vis-à-vis the group of lower-middle income countries as well as the world trend. By and large Viet Nam can be characterized by reporting a disproportionally high contribution of employment-led industries (where positive employment growth outpaces value added growth thereby leading to a negative productivity growth rate). Vietnamese policy makers should be aware of these dynamics as they may bring about important ramifications particularly in the context of the adoption of new technologies. We will highlight this connection in the subsequent paragraphs. Value added per capita and the employment-population ratio can be calculated as (Value added per capita = Value added/population) and (Employment − population ratio = Employment/population), respectively.↩ Throughout this chapter, we refer to the ‘full’ sample as the complete INDSTAT data set containing all countries and years for the time span 1963 to 2017.↩ Percentiles calculated in terms of rankings: \\(1- 41/57 \\approx 26\\%\\) and \\(1- 56/57 \\approx 2\\%\\) for value added and employment, respectively.↩ This is an important fact to consider as the mean (average) of a sequence of numbers is sensitive to outliers, in other words it can increase (decrease) considerably if one of the values is very big (small) relative to the other ones.↩ Conversely, a negatively skewed distribution (histogram) has a longer left tail (has more lower values).↩ "],
["adoption.html", "Section 5 Adoption of new technologies 5.1 Capital goods 5.2 Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies 5.3 Adoption dynamics within the industry 4.0-ready goods", " Section 5 Adoption of new technologies When it comes to the generation of new technologies, economies can either create these themselves or import them. It has been widely established in economic research that the latter is more common and probably also easier to attain from the point of view of a developing country: Particularly for industry 4.0 technologies, there is a clear group of leading economies which push the frontier of digital technologies in manufacturing outward. It is typically this technology that then gets distributed through trade across the globe. Consequently, it makes sense to investigate, how the trade dynamics between these leading economies and the rest of selected countries differ. In order to measure trade dynamics we resort to different indicators of import and export indicators. We do this to highlight different speeds and intensities of technology adoption across countries over time. For the purpose of this exercise we consider a heterogeneous group of countries. This group consists of a set of advanced economies (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea), all of which are big players in the adoption and generation of new technologies (see Box 1). The list of countries is complemented by a group of emerging economies (China, the Russian Federation as well as Viet Nam and Georgia). These countries have been selected with the purpose to illustrate particular development patterns observed in the adoption strategies of industry 4.0 technologies. As we have seen in Chapter ?? industry 4.0 technologies are a sub-group of capital goods. Whereas the former identify cutting-edge technologies one is most likely to find in modern, state of the art manufacturing facilities, capital goods cover a much broader domain. Capital goods are machinery and other manufactured goods which are used by industry, government and non-profit private institutions. They are in fact producers’ goods that are defined as part of fixed capital formation. (UN, 2002) However, it goes without saying that capital goods form one of the central building blocks of a healthy and growing manufacturing sector: Economic research has demonstrated that manufacturing provides great potential for positive growth trajectories through its scalability and high degree of capital accumulation, both of which can be identified through the utilisation of capital goods. Consequently, we begin our analysis on the level of the capital goods group which can be understood to represent both the latest as well as already more established production technologies. We then move on to apply the same tools for the sub-group of capital goods that allow us to identify industry 4.0-specific dynamics. We do this with the goal to provide a simple tool for policy makers to analyse and categorise where their own economy stands relative to other economis and the global level, both in the utilisation of capital goods as well as industry 4.0-ready technology as part of the domestic production processes. However, it must be stressed that the mere adoption of new technologies through importation does not guarantee the local absorption and diffusion. For this to be a successful strategy, the pre-conditions and enabling environment of a country matter. In other words, in order to move from being a follower to a leader more is needed than technology imports from abroad. For a successful adoption of these technologies and the establishment of state-of-the-art technology in a country, a strong foundation of prerequisits and capabilities is needed (see EQuIP too 9). 5.1 Capital goods The first graph (Figure 5.1) shows shares of imports of capital goods in all goods (indicator xx) between 2002 and 2017. A number of interesting points emerge. Advanced economies (Germany, Japan, Rep. of Korea) display relatively low import shares that are stable or slightly decreasing over time. This does not mean that these countries are not adopting technology via imports but, as we will see when we look at their exports below, they are increasingly producing capital goods themselves, they are leading exporters. Georgia also shows low shares of imports but also low shares of exports, so in this case, we can think of Georgia as slow adopter of technology. In China, Viet Nam and the Russian Federation, imports of capital goods made up a larger share of total imports and thereby potentially introducing new technology at higher, but also decreasing, rates. Figure 5.1: Share of capital goods imports in total imports An immediate question arising from this initial analysis is that of how policy makers can obtain a benchmark relating country performance patterns to global dynamics. For this, and to get a better understanding of how to interpret different importing behaviour, we have to also look at exports. This way, we can find out if a low import share can be a sign of a technology leader (such as Germany, Japan or Rep. of Korea) that is no longer importing technolgy or of a country not (yet) able to adopt new technology. We propose two indicators to facilitate this requirement: By calculating the import shares relative to the world average (indicator xx), one can quantify the import performance of a country in relation to the world average. This relation is called ‘revealed comparative advantage’ (RCA). If a country is characterized by an import RCA larger than one, this means that it imports more than the world average. In turn, this could point to a faster adoption of technology for countries that are not yet at the technological frontier. In that sense, the RCA of imports (indicator xx) is strongly connected to the adoption rate (indicator xx) as both indicators depend on the share of goods in total imports. We will see the same overall import profiles across countries with both indicators but the interpretation changes. As the second indicator, RCA exports (indicator XX), serves as a key measure to detect the local capabilities of countries in producing goods. As before, if a country is characterized by an RCA (export) larger than 1, it exports more than the global average. This means that it has acquired capabilities to export sophisticated and technology intensive goods and is competitive on the global stage. Figure 5.2: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of capital goods An interesting picture emerges from the figure above. There are potentially four groups of countries; the first group consists of high-income countries that import relatively fewer capital goods but export relatively more. This means they produce these goods themselves. The second group are developing or transition countries such as Georgia that import relatively few capital goods and also export relatively few. This might point to a lack of capabilities to use those goods and the technology that comes with them. Alternatively, especially larger countries in this group could be producing and using capital goods locally only. The third group, here represented by the Russian Federation, shows an import RCA above one but an export RCA close to zero. This means they import capital goods but are not export them relative to the world average. The fourth group, here represented by Viet Nam and China, imports and exports relatively many capital goods. Viet Nam is an interesting example as it is the only country in this subset that transitioned from being similar to Georgia (group two) to being similar to China. On the basis of the indicators shown we can create a classification of the following sort. RCA import RCA export Group &lt; 1 &gt; 1 Leader &gt; 1 &gt; 1 “Emerging” &gt; 1 &lt; 1 Follower &lt; 1 &lt; 1 Non-adopter (yet) Here, a ‘leader’ is a country with an import RCA of below (or close to) and an export RCA greater than one. These countries have a revealed comparative advantage in exporting goods (but not in importing) and are typically the ones closest to the technology frontier. Next up we have the ‘emerging’ economies which have a comparative advantage in both importing and in exporting. Here it is important to emphasise that, despite the fact that they have an import and export RCA greater than one, most likely ‘emerging’ economies do not import the same set of goods as they export. This means that if we identify a country as a ‘distributor’ for, say, capital goods, it makes sense to ‘dig deeper’ and look at what kind of capital goods the country imports and exports. Most likely this is where we will be able to identify some differences: A country may be a strong exporter for some groups of goods, while it may still be a follower when it comes to the adoption of the latest available technology. We can see this through the analysis of RCAs of industry 4.0 goods. The third group, which we define as ‘followers’, are countries with an import RCA bigger than one and an export RCA smaller than one. These are the countries that typically try to adopt new technology through imports and absorption. Lastly, with both RCAs below one (and typically very low) or missing, we find the group of ‘non-adopter (yet)s’. These countries do not engage in the adoption or dispersion of these goods in any traceable way. 5.2 Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies While the numbers above concerned all capital goods, we now focus on 4.0 (ready) goods, such as goods related to additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM or robotics which are part of the ‘smart factory’. The following graph (Figure 5.3) shows the share imports of 4.0 goods in total imports (in percent). First, the worldwide numbers are remarkably stable over time. During the first decade of the century, the Russian Federation, China and Viet Nam decreased their relative imports of 4.0 goods. With the exception of China, the rest of the subset increased their relative imports, albeit very slowly. The Russian Federation reached their 2002 level again in 2017 with slightly less than 0.6 percent of imports being 4.0 goods. Figure 5.3: Share of 4.0 goods imports in total imports Again, as a benchmark exercise and to interpret the shares, the following shows the revealed comparative advantage for 4.0-ready goods. Numbers above one indicate imports or exports above the world average respectively. Figure 5.4: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of 4.0 goods Applying the classification framework to the analysis of capital goods and industry 4.0 goods as done above, we can compile the following table. Capital goods (import RCA/export RCA) Industry 4.0 goods (import RCA/export RCA) Leader Germany(0.8, 1.2) Germany (1.0, 2.0) Japan (0.8, 1,4) Japan (0.5, 4) Korea (1.1, 1.6) Korea (0.9, 1.0) Emerging Viet Nam (1.5, 1.5) China (1.3, 1.6) Follower Russian Federation (1.2, 0.2) China (1.5, 0.8) Russian Federation (2.5, 0.1) Viet Nam (1.3, 0.1) Non-adopter (yet) Georgia (0.4, 0.2) This insight may allow us to conclude thatsome countries do not yet import capital goods or 4.0 goods, while some others are importing industry 4.0 technology but have not yet moved into a leading position in these technlologies which would allow them to also engage actively in exporting. Again, some others are on the way of adopting these technology, and another group of countries are technology leaders and main exporters of 4.0 goods. These first indicators provide the policy maker with an overview of a country and comparison with other countries on where they stand in terms of overall technology adoption and absorption by looking at trade patterns of capital goods as well as 4.0-ready goods. 5.3 Adoption dynamics within the industry 4.0-ready goods We just saw that, e.g. Japan is a leader in technology. In order know if Japans success is based on a single technology or more evenly spread, we cann distinguish different goods. Based on chapter ??, we differentiat between goods classified as additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM and (other) Robotics. Figure 5.5 shows again the share of imports (in percent) of total imports of a country. Figure 5.5: Import share (%) in total imports The first observation is that import shares are very low across countries with a maximum of around 0.4 percent in 2017. This might not be surprising as these goods are among the newest generation of technological capital goods. What is a bit surprising, on the other hand, is that countries show an overall declining or stagnant share of imports in additive manufacturing or CAD-CAM. What is more, the relative position of countries did not change from the more aggregate goods above. This pattern changes, however, when we look at Robotics where shares of imports of robots in total imports are increasing for the most part. Additionally to study RCA as above, we can also asses the economic importance of these imports when we compare them to a country’s production (indicator XX). Figure 5.6 presents imports in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). This way we can see that, e.g., Viet Nam is in the group of ‘emerging’ economies and followers when it comes to imports of goods in total imports, but relative to their overall production, they import much more 4.0-ready goods than the other countries in this sample. Relating imports to a country’s production can thus help give more context to import shares and indicate which goods or technologies are important numerically. Figure 5.6: Share of 4.0 goods imports in nominal GDP This chapter provided the policy maker with a set of indicators that have to be used in conjunction in order to understand technology adoption patterns. We combine import shares to see the importance of a (group of) good(s) and their potential to help in the adoption with RCA of imports and exports to classify countries into leaders or followers. Disaggregating the data can highlight if a country specializes in particular goods or technologies or if it lacks some of them completely. This can help the policy maker identify potential strengths and weaknesses in the adoption process and points to areas of potential policy interventions. "],
["robots-in-manufacturing.html", "Section 6 Robots in Manufacturing 6.1 Robot intensity 6.2 Manufacturing employment risk exposure", " Section 6 Robots in Manufacturing We now focus on robots in particular. On the one hand, we can get more detailed insights into one product group where countries show increasing import shares (see Chapter ??) and on the other hand, when we think of jobs being at risk of automation, it is mostly robots that come to mind. As Mayer (2018) points out, the manufacturing sector is characterised by a number of routine jobs and therefore particularly exposed to the potential substition of labour by robots. We first measure the development of robots used compared to human labour (robot intensity) and subsequently, the risk of job loss from automation. We lose some Countries (e.g. Georgia) in the analysis due to data limitations of the robot dataset. 6.1 Robot intensity Robot intensity measures the ratio of the number of robots relative to the number of employees (indicator XX). On the downside, this indicator is narrowing its focus to the dimension of robots alone, whereas previous indicators were based on a broader range of industry 4.0 goods consisting of CAD - CAM, additive manufacturing and robots. Consequently, results presented in this section should always be interpreted in the context of robotics and are therefore not necessarily representative for the wider range of industry 4.0 related technologies or the wider adoption capabilities of any of the countries considered in this exercise. However, as the ‘smart factory’ is mostly about intelligently connecting machines (robots) and other parts of the production process, the use of industrial robots is a first indicator of how relevant or prepared countries are in this respect. Thus, we will look at the intensity of robots used in the production process by calculating the stock of robots per 1 million employees. If this ratio is increasing, we can interpret it as a measure of progress of a countries industrial automation capacities. Figure 6.1 shows the robot intensity on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is logged, so large values are much larger than low values. The figure replicates the patterns from above. Industrialised countries, such as Japan, Rep. of Korea or Germany already use up up to 80,000 robots per 1 million employees. On the other hand, in Viet Nam or the Russian Federation they range below 1,000 per million employees. In total, with the exception of Japan, all selected countries show an increase in robot intensity over time. Figure 6.1: Robot intensity: robots per 1 Mio. manufacturing employees 6.2 Manufacturing employment risk exposure All observed countries increased their robot intensity over time. Against this background, an important dimension of the discussion surrounding new technology, are the potential benefits and risks of new technology. In the context of robots, it is the effect of robot-based automation. In a similar way to the employment composition analysis in EQuIP Tool 5: Employment Composition we can quantify the risk of manufacturing employment exposure stemming from automation. This concept is of particular complexity as automation itself is technology-biased and more likely to affect industries (and countries) which are high in capital intensity. This makes the issue of employment risk exposure a particularly multifaceted concept which depends on numerous factors. Three main components are discussed in the remainder of this section. The first and most straight forward factor is that of the existence of a solid manufacturing basis. Countries with a severely under-developed manufacturing sector, and potentially a more agricultural configuration of the economy, are potentially not very likely to expect much automation-induced unemployment because of the emergence of improvements in production processes in the medium to high-technology industries. Under the assumption of a well-developed manufacturing basis, the effect of automation-induced unemployment further depends on the industrial composition of a country’s industry. A recent study (Mayer, 2018) identifies the manufacturing share as a second important variable representing a threat of job destruction from industry 4.0 penetration. The argument is that the manufacturing sector is the one more characterized by routine jobs and sensitive to robot/human capital substitution. He identifies a subset of manufacturing industries that are considered to be at a high-risk of automation (see Table 6.1). As he points out, “job displacement by robots in relatively skill-intensive and well-paying manufacturing, such as the automotive and electronics sectors, is more profitable than in relatively labour intensive and low-paying sectors, such as apparel” and that “economic factors are more important for robot deployment than the technical possibilities of automating workers’ tasks”. Of course this set of industries might change over time when other sectors become more skill intensive or when the technology evolves. Table 6.1: Sectors vulnerable to robot-based automation, based on Mayer (2018) ISIC.rev..3.industry.code Industry.name 24 Chemicals 25 Rubber and plastic 31 Electronic appliances 34A Automobile vehicles Applying this industry classification of high-risk industries to our country sample, Figure 6.2 shows the share of workers in sectors Chemicals, Rubber and Plastic, Electrical Appliances as well as Automotive Vehicles (indicator XX). It illustrates the notably higher exposure shares for the set of advanced economies of our sample (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea) while the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and Georgia report a relatively low and stable trend over time. Given its dynamic growth and aspiration to become a technology leader itself, the trade-off between technological advancement and employment risk exposure becomes very obvious for the case of China: Within 10 years (between 2007 and 2017) China has increased its exposure share by around 7 percentage points and now closes in to the group of most advanced economies. Figure 6.2: Share of employees at risk of automation Robots are used in different industries to different degrees. In 2016, for our country sub-sample, two thirds of robots were employed in Automotive and Electronics, which overlaps with the sectors identified above. There is considerable variation across countries. Germany uses robots relatively intensely producing cars compared to to other industries. The Republic of Korea and Japan do so even more and additionally are robot-intensive producers of electronics. Viet Nam, the Russian Federation or China use robots much less intensely with China relatively evenly across industries and the Russian Federation more skewed towards automobiles and Metals. Viet Nam uses robots relatively more intensely in the production of plastic and chemical products. Figure 6.3: Robot intensity: robots per 1 Mio. manufacturing employees Similarly to the previous chapter, we have to combine indicators in order to get to preliminary conclusion if workers are at risk of robot-based automation. In order to do that and as one way of reaching a conclusion, we follow Mayer (2018) in looking at a large sample of 111 countries to see if we find more general patterns. Figure 6.4 relates average (2002-2016) risk sector employment (indicator XX) to total manufacturing employment (indicator XX). Further, we can distinguish countries by income group and by their average robot intensity (size of points, indicator XX). Overall, there is a positive correlation between the share of employment in manufacturing and the share of employees in the risk sectors. Grouping countries by income, we can see that employees in developed as well as in upper middle income countries are, on average, more exposed to risk of job loss due to automation, while least developed countries are not (yet) strongly exposed. We also see, that high income countries display higher robot intensities, confirming previous graphs. We can divide the graph into 4 quadrants. The top-left quadrant includes countries, where employment in risk sectors is relatively overrepresented. For example, in Mexico, 5% of all employees are in manufacturing industries. However, of those, over 30% are employed in risk sectors. Countries in the top-right quadrant show a high number of manufacturing employees overall and in risk sectors as well. In large parts, these are high-income and upper-income countries that already show the most intense robot use (size of symbol). These findings also pose a challenging conundrum: On the one hand they are suggestive of the interpretation that robot-based automation will not invalidate the important role of industrial development for less-developed economies per se; on the other hand, the fact that the use of robots is positively correlated with more high-skilled industries may bring about an even greater challenge to less-developed countries when it comes to sectoral upgrading. Basically, countries that want to increase their high-tech industry shares might, at least temporarilly, expose part of their labour to the risk of jobloss due to automation. Figure 6.4: Vulnerability to robot-based automation This last observation brings us to the third factor vital to the identification of manufacturing employment risk exposure; namely that of (non-) maturity of a country’s automation tendencies. This means, if a country shows signs of not increasing their robot intensity further. We can analyse this dimension by comparing the growth of robot intensity (indicator XX) of a country with the actual number of robots relative to the number of employees, i.e. robot intensity (indicator XX). This approach constitutes a simple stock-flow analysis and allows one to identify any changes in the robot-related adoption dynamics of a country which could be interpreted as a maturation effect: a low and static growth rate of robot intensity given a high relative number of robots per employee. For countries with such a maturity profile, the actual threat of job losses related to automatization is relatively low even though the risk of job-loss in the particular industry may remain high as a consequence of technological advancements. This profile puts them out of the ‘danger zone’ where technological advancements may bring about at least short-run involuntary employment disruptions. Conversely, countries which have not reached this stage of maturity yet can indeed be at risk of high robot-based automation vulnerability if they show a high growth rate in robot intensity as well as a steady increase in the stock over time. footnote(Conversely, a levelling out of the robot intensity growth rate at around zero with a robot stock significantly lower than that of more advanced countries could allow one to identify cases where the technology gap between leading economies and developing ones has increased to a degree from which industrial up-scaling has become practically infeasible (Mayer, 2018).) As is evident from Figure 6.4, the findings by Mayer (2018) suggest that countries characterized by a composition of the manufacturing sector tilted towards electronics, automotive and chemical industries are more vulnerable to job displacement because there job displacement is more profitable. A higher risk of job displacement could be associated with a higher robot intensity because countries which have already adopted robot technology more extensively, are also more inclined to continue with their robotization efforts because they already own all the necessary capabilities. However, this process is only expected to continue until countries reach a certain level of maturity in robotization. After that point it is unlikely that countries can continue to inject robots in the production system, and they will rather try to upgrade towards higher generations of industry 4.0 including artificial intelligence, big data and CAD – CAM. Therefore, risk of job displacement to manufacturing employment in emerging countries may be more apparent. Figure 6.5 shows the annual (2002-2015) growth rate of robot intensity on the Y-axis and the robot intensity on the X-axis. Technology leaders, such as Germany and Japan can be described as having reached a degree of maturity with a high yet very static degree of robot intensity over time. The Republic of Korea still seems to expand it’s robot intensity despite leading the pack already in 2014. Compared to the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and China seem to expand their relative stock of robots, albeit from a low level. Figure 6.5: Maturity effect of automation This chapter has shown that we have to combine different indicators to get a coherent picture of the automation processes. Although some sectors may show a higher likelihood of replacing labour by robots, it also matters which stage (maturity) the robotisation has already reached. If a country’s goal is to increase the degree of automation in the production process, at first it might expose labour to some risk of being replaced by robots, especially in mid- to high technology sectors. Once there is some maturity effect in the adoption of robots, the risk decreases again. Policy makers must be aware of the possible necessity to ease the transition for workers in the time of upgrading. This concludes the empirical section where we have presented sets of indicators that can help understand technology adoption and the short run risks and long run benefits that can come with it. Chapter ?? introduced the concept of ‘runner’ industries … Chapter @ref() showed a way of classifying countries as technology leaders or followers and distinguished overall capital goods and industry 4.0-ready goods. While chapter ?? took at detailed look at robots and how manufacturing jobs might be at risk from robot-based automation. "],

["deflation.html", "B Deflation of nominal value added series", " B Deflation of nominal value added series Deflation, i.e. eliminating the effect of inflation, of the value added series is a necessary intermediate step as high growth rates of nominal value added might be the consequence of strong price increases (inflation). Consequently, nominal value added growth rates might wrongfully indicate an increase in productivity even though the effect is actually only driven by the variation in prices over time. Consequently, these price effects have to be eliminated from the nominal value added series. This is done by deflating the nominal value added sequences in order to obtain their real value added representation. For the purpose of this analysis we construct real value added sequences based on the methodology proposed in Haraguchi and Amann (2019) which is calculated as \\[ rVA_{ist} = nVA_{ist} \\times Deflator_{ist} \\] \\[ Deflator_{ist} = \\frac{nGO_{bst}}{nGO_{ist}} \\times IIP_{ist} \\] where \\(nVA\\), \\(rVA\\) denotes nominal and real value added in period \\(t\\), sector \\(s\\) and country \\(i\\), respectively.The \\(Deflator\\) is given by the ratio of nominal gross output (\\(nGO\\)) in the base year \\(b\\) relative to nominal gross output in period \\(t\\) and its corresponding Industrial Index of Production (IIP). The benefit of calculating real value added in this form is that it allows for the creation of an industry-specific deflator across countries, thereby facilitating the construction of comparative measures which is particularly important for a cross-country comparator analysis.

Given its characteristics, i.e. a positive productivity, value added and employment growth rate, a high share of runner industries in total manufacturing of a country means that on average a country’s manufacturing sector displays favourable productivity growth dynamics while also upholding employment growth; both of which are highly desirable outcomes. The idea of having a high share of runner industries in total manufacturing of the economy therefore stands to reason as it imposes an interesting enigma: The higher the share of industries that have grown over time, the higher your economic output. Yet, it is not opposed to the often times pursued goal of having a high share of medium-high technology industries forming the backbone of a sustainably developing manufacturing sector. This is because of the following two reasons: First of all, the overlap between the concept of medium-high technology industries and that of runners is substantial: three out of five identified runner industries belong to the group of medium-high technology industries as classified by UNIDO when considering the full data sample available through INDSTAT. For the post-2000 sample, this increases to six out of seven industries. What is more, the average productivity growth rate of high-technology industries (based on UNIDO classification) is roughly twice that of the low technology group.1 In this sense, the overlap created through the empirical identification of runner industries can be understood as a confirmation of the positive effect of technological advancements in manufacturing that can also be employment enhancing. Secondly, the concept of runner industries adds an additional layer of dynamism to the process as it enables one to capture within-industry structural change dynamics (see Box 2 for more context). Because of its dynamic nature, the concept of runner industries offers a gateway to an organic identification of newly emerging trends in manufacturing development: It allows for the possibility to capture the productivity and employment dynamics of an industry which may in fact transition from a low to medium-high technology configuration as a consequence of its adoption of new technology. This transition may then be accompanied by an increase in both productivity as well as employment demanding a particular and novel skill set. Whereas such dynamics can be unveiled using the concept of runner industries, it would remain hidden with the fixed classification of technology groups. Nonetheless, it goes without saying that the concept of runner industries should not be seen as a competing but rather a complementing measure when it comes to identifying favourable manufacturing sector compositions and should not replace the existing technology-centred paradigm. The link between short- and long-run dynamics. The relationship between a high share of runner industries and economic performance can also be summarized visually: In Figure 2, the shaded areas illustrate the share of runner industries in manufacturing value added for different percentiles of the data: In the darkest shade of grey, the minimum to 20th percentile of value added runner share contributions is visualized over time followed by the 20th to 40th percentile in a lighter shade of grey etc. The upper edge of the lightest grey is representing the country which has reported the highest share of runners in value added between the years 1990 to 2017. What is more, the coloured lines identify the average runner share for the set of developed, i.e. high income, and developing (all but high income) countries. In other words, for the average developed economy, the value added share of runner industries in manufacturing has increased from around 40 percent in 1999 to around 50 percent in 2016. Contrary to this, the corresponding share for the group of developing countries has remained stable at around the 40 percent mark. Figure D.1: Visualisation of concept. Similarly, considering the most recent two decades characterized by a fast-paced adoption of new technologies, the set of runner industries identified for the post-2000 period in Figure 3 display the same characteristics as that for the previously highlighted full sample: The average runner share of developed economies remains somewhat 10 percent higher compared to that of developing countries. This is particularly insightful as the set of runner industries identified for the post-2000 sample has been complemented by an additional high technology (chemicals) as well as one low technology (food and beverages) industry.

The concept of intra-industry upgrading is visualised in E.1: Schematic diagram: Red path: Intra-industry / within-industry structural change (i.e. an industry, from stage 1 to 4 depending on technological sophistication) Blue path: Inter-industry / between-industry structural change (shifting resources from LT to MHT industries) Departure: For instance, in the early stages of the development of the food and beverage industry, the window opportunity for the country could be the low-technology labour-intensive food production activities (grey box: low-technology). Capability enabling: With a long-term commitment from the government and other stakeholders, i.e. increasing investment etc., the country starts accumulating factor resources to upgrade its endowment structure (moving along the horizontal axis, from left to right). Reaching technical limitations (cap of the grey box: low-technology): Accumulation of factor resources (investment, capital etc.) for which the country fully exploits its labour cost advantages (also economies of scale etc.). In a static environment, the technical limitation in the food and beverage industry is reached. Decision making: Depending on the technological innovation capability of Viet Nam, breakthrough and mass diffusion of new technologies (i.e. 4IR technologies) could unlock the potential for Viet Nam to further deepen its food and beverage industry (a possibility of intra-industry leapfrogging, red box from stage 1 to 2/3). While this within-industry structural change / intra-industry upgrading provides equal if not more productivity gain for Viet Nam as compared to its MHT route between-industry structural change, i.e. shifting resources from the food and beverages industry to the non-metallic mineral industry (i.e. from low-technology to medium-low-technology industry).
