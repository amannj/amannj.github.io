["introduction.html", "Section 2 Introduction 2.1 Objective of this tool 2.2 Structure and concept of this tool", " Section 2 Introduction In many countries there are great expectations for the potential of the latest digital technology revolution and its effect on the economy. The emergence of connected and communicating smart devices boosts the idea of breakthrough technologies which are rapidly penetrating international markets. This is as true for the manufacturing sector as it is for the economy as a whole: Exemplarily, maintenance is now progressively governed by modern robots which run through powerful algorithms that can predict when and where to replace materials in a firm’s production process and react instantaneously. Similarly, humans are increasingly rather supervisors of production processes than manual executors of operations. At the same time, serious concerns on the socio-economic consequence on the adoption of these new and smart technologies have been voiced: There, the fear goes from the effect of jobless growth or potential job destruction all the way to the worry that modern technologies will result in a change in the economic development trajectory of developing countries. For example, the result of the re-shoring of previously outsourced production processes in the developing world could potentially lead to a situation where developing countries are not in a position anymore to capitalise on the same comparative advantages (low-skilled workers that attract production processes) compared to earlier industrialisers. This could lead developing countries to lose out on a fundamental and historically well-documented steppingstone in their development stage. With the mandate to provide a comprehensive and accessible approach to empirical policy benchmarking for the manufacturing sector, this EQuIP module seeks to provide a wide set of empirical instruments that allow for the identification and benchmarking of manufacturing-related dynamics that can be associated with the current wave of technological revolutions. In the literature this intersection of the fourth technological revolution and manufacturing is typically referred to as industry 4.0 (Anton, Silberglitt, and Schneider 2001). This tool also explores ways to measure how technology adoption is affecting the macroeconomic dimension of manufacturing development patterns and, most importantly, its potential effects on value added and employment generation. For this purpose, this document is structured as follows: In Section 2.1 we provide a general discussion of the objective and purpose of this tool by linking the emergence of new digital technology with the necessity of a multi-dimensional and manufacturing-specific analysis. It also highlights the theoretical ramifications by pointing at the recent academic and policy-relevant literature. In Section 2.2 we narrow down the concepts of what industry 4.0 constitutes in the context of the manufacturing production process. We will take the time to discuss the different dimensions one needs to take into consideration when trying to quantify the effect of how new and digital technologies may reshape the manufacturing industries of developing countries as we know them. We also stress the importance of looking at dynamics of changes in macroeconomic variables in order to understand the full scope of technological changes. In Section 3 we then move on to introduce a particular set of empirical indicators which will allow us to quantify the effects of the adoption of new digital technology in manufacturing which we then apply in Section 4 in a detailed cross-country study. 2.1 Objective of this tool 2.1.1 Industry 4.0: Manufacturing in the Digital Age 2.1.1.1 Distinctive in nature, … The fourth wave of technological innovations - which is characterized by the integration of digital connectivity and advanced technologies - gives rise to automated industrial systems and smart production processes that boost efficiency across economic activities. There is no doubt that this new wave of digital technology will inevitably reshape the face of the manufacturing sector as we know it. For example, this new wave encompasses the adoption of computers and automation enhanced by smart and autonomous systems. These in turn are fuelled by big data and complex artificial learning algorithms while digitally connected manufacturing embraces a wide variety of technologies, ranging from 3D printing to robotics, new materials, as well as biotechnology and smart production systems. It should become clear from this very broad definition that the effect of this new wave of digital technology will go way beyond the manufacturing sector and will also leave its marks on the service sector and the consumer market: IoT products1, such as autonomous cleaning robots or smart controls, that allow one to remotely control and change the room temperature of their house while being hundreds of kilometres away, have recently found their way out of sci-fi movies and into the lives of regular consumers. Even though exciting by themselves, this tool does not seek to analyse the effects these fantastic technologies may bring with them. Rather, our analysis focuses on the production-related dimension of manufacturing technologies. This distinction is important as the most recent digitalisation of the manufacturing production process also allows for the creation and distribution of different forms of intangible assets which are also of high relevance for the manufacturing industry: These include digital blueprints of production, different types of software, algorithms or, more generally, patents all of which complement the new and digital production cycle. This intangible dimension of the modern production process is a highly complex as well as regionally concentrated phenomenon where researchers have identified only a countable number of regions, countries and institutions to partake in this part of the modern economic process. While we provide a selective summary of the trends and directions this field has taken in BOX 2.1, the main focus of this tool is on the tangible dimension of the manufacturing production process. The reason for this is two-fold: First of all, many highly recognised international organisations have sought out to analyse the effect of intangibles in this equation. For this they need very detailed and specific information on firms and products; see BOX 2.2. Such an analysis is granular by its own definition and makes it rather difficult to arrive at a comprehensive and comparable strata of results across industries and countries. Particularly for the developing world, such a micro-founded analysis may leave some important aspects for policy evaluation unanswered. It is because of this that the purpose of this tool is somewhat different: Its goal is to provide policy makers across the developing world with tools to identify changes in the adoption behaviour of this new digital technology and to link it to macroeconomic outcome variables that lay at the heart of a policy maker: value added and employment. Because of this, the instruments proposed in this tool put special emphasis on the introduction of summary statistics that can be applied across a broad group of countries and manufacturing industries while retaining a high degree of space for interpretation and benchmarking. It goes without saying that this tool should therefore be seen as a complementing rather than a competing way of analysing the dispersion of digital technologies within manufacturing industries. A thorough analysis of this crucial question would therefore entail both a highly granular and micro firm-level data specific analysis together with this more macro- and cross-country oriented view on the effects of the adoption of digital technologies. 2.1.1.2 … yet part of a long history of technological change At the same time, this tool stresses the importance of not only looking across countries and industries but also to keep the time dimension of manufacturing development in mind. This becomes obvious by recognising that the term industry 4.0 already makes clear reference to the long history of three waves of technological change: Beginning in the late 18th century with the advent of steam power and the invention of the power loom, the first industrial revolution ushered in mechanisation and radically changed how goods were manufactured. In the late 19th century, electricity and assembly lines made mass production possible, giving rise to the second revolution. Many cite the third revolution as beginning in the 1970s, when advances in computing enabled pre-programmed machines and networks and thereby furthered automation. To that end, the fourth technological revolution signifies the current endpoint of technological evolution which allows us to connect machines and harvest their efficiency through coordination, automatised problem solving and the utilisation of new materials and production technologies. It goes without saying that all technologies associated with their respective revolutionary waves in the past were considered to be of a destructive nature: The introduction of assembly lines revolutionised not only the car manufacturing industries, but also posed a great challenge for workers. The same is true for the textile and garment industry and/or the emergence of IT systems in the past. It is therefore important to recognise that also in the past, new technological discoveries created threats as well as opportunities for the people and companies at the time and that one can expect similar from the most recent, digital wave: As estimated in a recent study (Frey and Osborne 2017), up to 47% of jobs have been identified to be ‘at risk of computerisation.’2 Similar predictions have been made by among others by Harari (2018) who argues that past waves have shifted human activity from physical to cognitive activity. This latter technological wave leads to the possibility of cognitive tasks being undertaken by machines, leaving very little for humans since they have no other abilities beyond physical and cognitive. While it is certainly true that with the emergence of even smarter and more sophisticated digital technologies the degree between digital/automatic and human skills have certainly increased, their consequences are to the current date still difficult to quantify and their scope and magnitude remain difficult to predict: Looking at job-related tasks rather than the jobs themselves, Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn (2016) find a much lower risk of computerisation compared to the occupation-based approach as illustrated by Frey and Osborne (2017), while they do also find that there are some particular jobs and industries that are more at risk of job loss as a result of computerisation. Consequently, workers, industries and countries which differ in their sectoral composition of the economy and labour force may be at very heterogeneous risks and threats. This point is important as it means that the new digital technology will not only bring big challenges in the future, it will also create winners and losers and will potentially result in increased inequality which opens the mandate for strong policy interventions. For example, Autor et al. (2018) has quantified the negative socio-economic effect of the disappearance of manufacturing jobs for young US American men that is due to an increase in international manufacturing competition. It is not unlikely that similar tendencies may be observed as a result of the adoption of new technologies in the developing world in the future. It is therefore of the utmost importance for policy makers to be aware of both the chances as well as threats the adoption of new and digital technology will bring for the economy in general and the manufacturing sector in particular: Where new production technologies will generate unprecedented growth for some industries, it will stifle others. Old jobs will disappear and new, more high-skilled ones will emerge. Consequently, finding the right framework and incentive structure that allows for the formation of the right capabilities to foster the creation of modern industries and successful job transition through skill upgrading while fighting inequality and other negative side-effects in a time of digital production technologies will create a challenge environment for policy makers in the future. It is the goal of this EQuIP tool to provide a set of useful indicators that will policy makers help navigate these challenges. 2.1.2 Beating the buzzer of technology adoption: Sluggish despite its high policy relevance 2.1.2.1 The slow uptake of industry 4.0 technologies in developing countries … Each industrial revolution marks a major turning point in the shift of technological, socio-economic and cultural conditions. Waves of technological change and paradigm shifts, driven by the surge of scientific discoveries, have followed one another in accelerated succession. Because accumulated technological and productive capabilities of countries differ, a ‘role model’ of successful adoption which would suit all countries does not exist; nor is there a one-size-fits-all policy solution in responding to challenges and opportunities (Lacasa et al. 2019; Lee and Malerba 2017). At the same time, the expectation of what the new wave of technological innovation could potentially bring to the table for the developing as well as developed world are at least twofold: For developed countries, industry 4.0 could be a way to regain manufacturing competitiveness. As for developing countries, industry 4.0 could provide a route to moving up the value chain, something that has become increasingly important to achieve in the face of rising labour costs.3 On the other hand, industry 4.0 could also lead to a further and more rapid reduction of manufacturing jobs in the developed world (Frey and Osborne 2017), while countries excluded from the 4th industrial revolution (e.g. the poorest countries) could be affected by the uptake in other countries (e.g. rich countries embracing new technologies, allowing them to compete with the poorest countries). In other words, the comparative advantage in terms of plentiful and cheap low-skilled labour may be offset by the adoption of these new technologies in the rich world. In this sense, policy makers may be eager to adopt industry 4.0 technologies and to ‘jump on the bandwagon’ of the unfolding industrial revolution either in the hopes of boosting economic performance (productivity), or because of the fear of otherwise falling behind in the adoption of these new technologies. However, the creation and diffusion of newly emerging digital technologies has so far remained extremely concentrated at the world level: For emerging technologies such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM), robotics or additive manufacturing, it is documented that less than 10 countries explain 85% of all triadic patents4 while 77% of all exports are directly associated with these technologies; see Appendix A. At the same time, 84 countries remain excluded from the global creation and use of these technologies (Foster-McGregor, Nomaler, and Verspagen 2019; Lavopa 2019). In the same vein and from a policy strategy point of view, Santiago (2019) illustrates that most of the highly industrialised countries have already paved their ways accelerating the economic transformation to embrace industry 4.0 while developing countries seem to be lagging behind in this respect. The author documents that at least nine industrialising countries have announced national strategies around advanced manufacturing, a diversity of approaches, including industrial policies or science, technology and innovation plans, or standalone feasibility studies. Regarding developing countries, several middle-income economies, like the BRICS members, are already adopting smart manufacturing and are even entering areas traditionally reserved for highly industrialized countries (Daudt and Willcox 2016; López-Gómez et al. 2017). For instance, China is adopting industrial development strategies that seek to capitalize on new windows of opportunity where it can benefit from its increasing ability to produce new technologies: Its search for value addition and enhanced technological content is superseding traditional cost advantage strategies (Lee 2019). Apart from large developing countries, only a handful of smaller counterparts have defined or are in the process of developing strategic policy agendas around smart manufacturing; something which is rarely observed for the group of the least developed economies. 2.1.2.2 … and the importance of capabilities However, the willingness and, probably even more importantly, readiness of a country to adopt new technologies requires a minimum base of successfully developed industrial capabilities. Lavopa (2019) shows a clear positive relationship between the adoption roles across different countries; both in terms of innovators and producers as well as, more generally, when it comes to the utilization of technologies associated with the 4th industrial revolution and their average set of industrial capabilities. Similarly, Andreoni and Anzolin (2019) have identified five categories of challenges which explain the gap between developing and developed countries when it comes to their engagement with industry 4.0 technologies and encompass areas such as basic capabilities, retrofitting and integration, digital infrastructure, the digital capability gap as well as access and affordability. On the basis of this it should become clear that the development of the right capabilities and prerequisites form a crucial building block in the successful adoption of new and digital technologies. At the same time, the development of such ‘enablers of development’ go far beyond the immediate concept of digital technology adoption within manufacturing. Rather, they are fundamental for the successful development of a country as a whole. The EQuIP toolbox has long recognised the integral importance of the successful development of such capabilities and prerequisites and has created a specific tool for this: EQuIP TOOL 9: Industrial Capabilities Indicators5 captures a country’s different types of industrial capabilities to facilitate a better understanding of the role they play in industrial production, technological and structural change: Countries’ industrial capabilities are various types of firms’ competencies (associated with production and its organisation, technological change and innovations) as well as firms’ production capacity (determined by investments in machines, equipment and other capital goods). Countries’ industrial capabilities also relate to the physical and institutional infrastructure supporting the overall productive economy. This is why countries’ industrial capabilities are the main ‘drivers’ and ‘enablers’ of countries’ industrial competitiveness. Because of its extensive nature, the interested reader is kindly referred to this particular tool for a more insightful and detailed discussion. At the same time, a further discussion on the role of capabilities in the wake of the emergence of new digital technology with a focus on firm-level evidence in developing countries is provided in Cantore (2019). 2.1.3 Learning through adoption: Trade as the key channel of industry 4.0 technology adoption. Adoption and diffusion of technology across the ecosystem are fundamental steps to capitalize on the window of opportunity of industry 4.0. The experiences of some of the most successful manufacturing firms in East Asia suggest that learning is not possible without adoption. There, most of the successful firms were documented to have started with the adoption of foreign technology for production first and then learned from using and finally enhanced further productivity by mastering these technologies (Lee 2019). For instance, South Korea and Taiwan followed in the footsteps of an early industrialiser, Japan. Similar episodes of imitate-to-innovate have also fuelled the successful emulation of new production processes and products in China. From latecomers to followers, benchmarking adoption is crucial. A key concern of today’s latecomers is whether they have invested enough resources at the national level as part of the adoption process of new technology in order to turn into a successful follower and, if not, how far they fall behind. An important insight from the historical perspective is that latecomers do not necessarily have to become original inventors of new technologies themselves. Rather, taking small, well-informed steps to test technological and policy options according to the goals desired, has proved to be the preferred strategy before fully committing to the implementation of the policy tool at hand. Building on this rationale, the main starting point to a successful adoption of industry 4.0 technologies among developing countries could either be that of a fast-paced adoption process of the emerging technologies or a more adaptive response to the local circumstances through incremental, follow-on innovations. In either case, the import of industry 4.0 goods6 can be an indicator of adoption of technological change for developing countries. Contribution 1: The adoption of new technologies The first contribution of this tool is to provide a simple set of measures to quantify the adoption of new technologies that are linked to the industry 4.0 domain across countries. This tool introduces a methodology that allows one to measure, quantify and categorise differences in technology adoption and diffusion strategies across economies through the trade structure of industry 4.0 goods. 2.1.4 The impact of industry 4.0 on employment: different mechanisms at play, uncertain outcome. “The difference between human labour and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not.” (Leontief 1958). While this statement has most certainly been in the past, it has also been argued more recently, e.g. by Harari (2018), that while past waves of technological revolutions have shifted human activity from physical to cognitive activity, the latest technological wave leads to the possibility of cognitive tasks being undertaken by machines. This may lead to a higher degree of competition between humans and machines and also leaves less room for humans overall, since they have no other abilities beyond physical and cognitive. In other words, automation replaces repetitive tasks and creates new, more complex tasks. At the same time, smart technologies may also ‘eat up’ parts of the cake. Will there be room for future employment despite these trends? The labour forces in most of the economies are no longer dominated by an undifferentiated mass of unskilled workers but rather characterized by workers with a dynamic skills portfolio. Tasks previously performed by labour are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement labour, known as the labour augmenting effect. Consequently, the effects of automation could typically be counterbalanced by the creation of new complex tasks in which labour has a comparative advantage; even more so if skill-enabling technology is introduced. Such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - they reinstate labour into a broader range of tasks through re-skilling and up-skilling. Automation directly takes jobs away from unskilled labour who specialize in routine and repetitive tasks and new tasks tend to benefit skilled workers. This process increases social inequality in the short run, however, the standardization of new tasks over time tends to help low-skill workers to handle more complex tasks. To this extent, both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality in the short run, but it also presents the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run. These effects have been readily studied by the automation literature; see for example Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) or Aghion, Jones, and Jones (2017). As estimated in a recent study Frey and Osborne (2017), examine expected impacts of future computerisation on US labour market outcomes. According to their elaboration, about 47% of total US employment is at risk of computerisation. What is more, the study finds that wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with an occupation’s probability of computerisation. In other words, it is particularly the less educated and qualified working class population that are most effected by the emergence of smart digital technology. While it is certainly true that with the emergence of even smarter and more sophisticated digital technologies the degree of substitution between digital/automatic and human skills has certainly increased (Frey and Osborne 2017; Harari 2018), their consequences are to the current date still challenging to quantify and their scope and magnitude remain difficult to predict: Looking at job-related tasks rather than the jobs themselves, Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn (2016) find a much lower risk of computerisation compared to the occupation-based approach as illustrated by Frey and Osborne (2017), while they do also find that there are some particular jobs and industries that are more at risk of job loss as a result of automatability. Consequently, workers, industries and countries which differ in their sectoral composition of the economy and labour force may be at very heterogeneous risks and threats. This important insight has also been confirmed by Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018). With the outcome on jobs remaining uncertain, two observations seem hardly disputed: For one, the demands on employment and skills brought about by the fourth industrial revolution highlight the human capital as a key enabler to industrial development, where insufficient exposure to high-technology jobs can hinder the ability to adapt and respond to the disruptive changes expected from industry 4.0 (Kraemer-Mbula 2019; Leopold, Ratcheva, and Zahidi 2017). Secondly, heterogeneous employment effects across types of jobs and industries are to be expected across countries(Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn 2016; Frey and Osborne 2017; Nedelkoska and Quintini 2018). Because manufacturing industries are characterized by different structures of labour-capital composition, it is likely that the impact of automation on manufacturing will differ across industries. Moreover, different technologies are accompanied by productivity effects of varying magnitudes, and, hence, one set of automation technologies will not impact labour demand in the same way as others. As a matter of fact, there are multiple industries that can enjoy productivity dividends while enjoying employment generation; either because new production processes require manual input at different points of the production process (Autor 2015) or because only particular tasks of an employee’s job description have been ‘rationalized away’ (Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn 2016).7 From the above discussion it should be clear that the threat of automatisation is closely linked with country-specific characteristics and the configuration of the manufacturing sector: If a country’s manufacturing sector is not strongly developed in industries where digital technologies will have their greatest impact, the fear of computerisation-induced unemployment may be rather limited. On the other hand, if a country is particularly strong in these industries, computerisation may be of high relevance and should therefore be monitored closely. To that end, in order to quantify the risk of job loss that is due to computerisation, is important to narrow down the scope of the analysis and make it more precise: On the one hand, we will focus on the type of computerisation that is most obviously connected to the potential of job loss in the developing world: In the context of manufacturing, the threat to employment is that as creative destruction unfolds, the destructive part is expected to fall primarily on industries with robot-based automation (Mayer 2018). This is a highly dynamic area as rapid technological change has halved the price of industrial robots between 1990 and 2005 (Graetz and Michaels 2018) which means that industrial robots are probably closer to a cost-efficient substitute to human workers than ever before.8 Contribution 2: Robots and job loss in manufacturing The second contribution of this tool is to offer a set of instruments that allow policy makers to identify and quantify the (potential) threat in terms of employment loss that is due to the emergence and adoption of robot-based automation. It proposes a combination of a comprehensive set of indicators that allow for a country- and industry-specific benchmarking across countries. 2.1.5 The view ahead: What to expect from industry 4.0 in the medium and long run? One economic fundamental is that any kind of technological innovation will only gain a foothold if it is beneficial for the firm to adopt the new technologies. In other words, only if the newly available technologies result in an improvement of the production processes by making them more productive, new technological possibilities will be integrated in the production processes of an economy. These fundamentals are as true for any previously adopted technology as they are in the context of the most recent wave of technological advancements: When countries plan their strategies for industry 4.0, their expectation is an increase of productivity in the production process while ideally preserving if not by increasing jobs through the opening of new markets. The traditional neoclassical growth accounting method has been the standard method in the literature to estimate the contributions of technological change and capital upgrading to output growth. There, productivity gains in terms of production factors are typically described to stem from (a) a process of capital deepening, i.e. a more extensive use of machinery relative to manual labour; as well as (b) an increase in productivity (defined as the ratio of value added created per employee in the production process). In most of the developing countries, the improvement in productivity is a result of the growth in capital stock – more machines replacing the mass of low skilled workers. On the other hand, increases of total factor productivity, i.e. technology growth as a result of the implementation of new technologies, is more apparent in developed countries. Without a further decomposition, expected impacts as seen in productivity may vary from the effect of capital deepening as opposed to the increase in capital per worker to the effect of pure technology growth. In this sense, productivity is an imperfect proxy of impact of technological change, yet its analysis allows one to derive important insights as far as the dynamics of production processes is concerned. The reason this tool puts particular emphasis on the role of productivity as opposed to capital deepening is threefold: First of all, productivity allows one to capture the ‘learning effect’ associated with the adoption of new technology, e.g. through the more efficient handling of new machinery over time. Secondly, obtaining concise measurement on capital stocks across industries is an advanced and rather technical exercise probably more suited for a more academic discussion and would certainly miss the scope and objective of EQuIP. Lastly, and most importantly, the concept of productivity is closely linked to two variables of high policy relevance: The measure of performance (value added) and inclusion (employment) of an industry. It is at the core of the second tier (on technology absorption and productivity) of this tool to provide guidance on how productivity growth can be reconciled with the objective of increases in performance and reciprocity.9 The central question linking the concept of industry 4.0 adoption and productivity growth are the following: What can we learn from past waves of technological change? Can past technological change tell us something about industry 4.0 adoption? On the one hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies can be monitored year by year through opportune indicators. The preparedness for the possible impacts of industry 4.0 adoption on productivity and employment in different industries becomes a key element in anticipating possible responses to the adoption of industry 4.0. In that sense, no one can anticipate what will be the consequences of industry 4.0 technology adoption; however, at least one can learn by analysing data from past waves of technological change. This is because the previous waves of technological innovations have been observed through the same productivity transmission channels as the most recent wave related to industry 4.0; and their adoption rate has also been determined by the degree to which they have facilitated an improvement in the production capacity across industries. Based on these insights, the following propositions can be made: Technological change did not happen to the same extent in all countries. The effects of the most recent wave of technological innovation will vary greatly across industries: Even though industry 4.0 will affect all countries and industries, the degree may differ substantially. Exemplarily, there is no reason to believe that industry 4.0 should only affect either high income countries or particular industries. Technological change did not happen in all industrial sectors to the same extent. As with all previous industrialization waves, different countries adopt different strategies at different periods of time. Not because they were necessarily ‘too late’ but rather because their industrial composition demands a different policy approach than that of other countries. Technological change is not always reflected in a simultaneous increase of manufacturing value added, productivity and employment, but it often generates trade-off. Some industries might have retained a productivity profile that is highly favourable for the economic development of the country in question. This, however, does not imply that the same approach would work for any other country. Contribution 3: The interplay between technological change and productivity growth The third contribution of this tool is to link the current debate on technological revolution that is due to the emergence of smart digital technology to macroeconomic indicators across manufacturing industries. The instruments presented in this tool allow for a simple analysis of the differences in the dynamics of manufacturing industry’s productivity, value added and employment growth dynamics over time. It also proposes a simple way to analyse and compare country-specific industry profiles across aggregates and over time and furthermore defines a simple forward-looking tool to identify the direction into which a particular manufacturing industry is developing. 2.2 Structure and concept of this tool 2.2.1 Introduction In many countries there are great expectations regarding the potential of the latest wave of the digital technology evolution and its effect on the economy. International organisations such as the World Bank, the OECD as well as UNIDO have devoted large part of their resources to providing a better understanding of how these new technologies may reshape our economies; see Box 2.1 for more information. Box 2.1: Intangibles vs. tangibles in the domain of new digital technologies and industry 4.0. A lot of research has gone into unveiling the dimension of intangible technologies related to the latest wave of technology advancements. Exemplarily, Vincent, Vertesy, and Damioli (2019) identify a tremendous increase in AI patenting activities since 2013 with a significant boom in 2015-2016. They also observe a very high concentration of artificial intelligence (AI) intellectual properties in a few countries and organisation. What is more, while most of AI patenting activities remain concentrated in the sectors. These include the fields of software programming as well as high-technology sectors such as medicine, aeronautics, electronic equipment and machinery as well as vehicles are among the main users of this emerging technology, but AI patents seem to rapidly grow in traditionally less technology-intensive fields, such as food and beverages and agriculture. For the purpose of this EQuIP module, we take a close look at the effects of industry 4.0 and the adoption of new technologies on the manufacturing sector. Even though this of course only allows us to cover parts of the effect of the adoption of new, digital technologies, we provide a very clear and granular focus on the manufacturing industries and developing countries in particular. While this differentiates our efforts from other studies on this topic, we want to point out that the analysis conducted in this tool should be seen as a complementing rather than a holistic analysis on new technologies. Box 2.2: Micro-level evidence on the effect of industry 4.0 in advanced economies. Different to the more cross-country and manufacturing-industry specific focus of this EQuIP module, other institutions have taken a more granular/specific look at the effect of digitalisation on productivity: For example, Andrews, Nicoletti, and Timiliotis (2018) try to identify drivers of digital adoption for European countries while Gal et al. (2019) study the potential for productivity growth coming from digital technology. Both papers resort to firm-level data for firms to look at firm-level characteristics and the gap between firms at the technological frontier and the rest. What is more, they use digital technologies such as access to high-speed internet, simple and complex cloud computing as well as back and front office integration systems. What both papers find is that drivers of firm-level adoption are capabilities such as managerial and technical skills as well as business-related incentives such as the business environment in terms of competition. In essence, both papers conclude with the following policy suggestions: Skills must be upgraded by enhancing initial education and training systems as they are prerequisites to adopt digital technology; Infrastructure, such as access to broadband internet must be improved; Barriers to starting firms must be lowered; New competition policy for platform firms must be put into place; Financial constraints, especially for young firms must be lowered and tax systems updated; Lastly, it has to be stressed that it is usually a small fraction of firms at the technological frontier that adopt new technologies fastest. Digital adoption seems to be a strong indicator for productivity gains. When considering the effects of technological revolutions on manufacturing processes, it is important to understand that technological evolution is hardly a one-way street; it rather is an important and interconnected part of a modern economy. Figure 2.1 illustrates this point: New technologies (such as industry 4.0) will only really be adopted into the production processes of an economy, if there is something to be gained from it. These potential gains could be manifold10 but typically also affect the efficiency of a production process: If a particular new technology allows a company to produce more output with the same amount of input, it will be eager to adopt this technology. If these technologies are adopted by many/all firms of country, their productivity gains reach macro-economic dimensions, and macroeconomic indicators will reflect the changes in the production dynamics which are the result of the newly adopted technology.11 Figure 2.1: The interplay between new technologies (industry 4.0), capabilities and productivity. On the other hand, new technology is rarely something that appears out of nowhere. It is well understood that research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures are a great indicator of the success of a company: If a company tries to research how new technologies may improve their own production processes, this will not only set the company apart from less R&amp;D-engaged competitors but it also result in the creation of new technology as a whole. In this sense, the pursuit of productivity growth also leads to the development of new technologies. It should become clear from this, that dimensions of ‘adoption of new technologies’ and ‘productivity’ are two sides of the same coin and should always be considered together. The latter point is important as new digital technology will not only be restricted to a few sectors or industries but rather the economic configuration of the whole economy; see Box 2.3 for a more details. Box 2.3: Digital technology industry classification. Calvino et al. (2018) proposes a taxonomy of sectors according to the extent to which they have gone digital. They build their indicator on a battery of measures of digital complexity such as the share of ICT tangible and intangible investment as well as purchases of intermediates, share of specialised personnel or the stock of robots (see original paper for more information). While they find, that some sectors such as telecom and IT services are positioned consistently at the top of the distribution of sectors in terms of their adoption of new digital technologies, other industries vary more strongly across the proposed dimensions of the indicator. For within the manufacturing sectors, the authors identify the electrical equipment, machinery as well as transport equipment and electronics to be the most digitally intensive industries. At the same time, it goes without saying that the connection between the adoption of new technologies and productivity growth is a very complex question. As illustrated in Figure 2.1, what glues these two domains together are the right capabilities and preconditions that are needed to allow for a successful communication of both domains. Because of the importance of this component, EQuIP TOOL 9: Industrial Capabilities Indicators is dedicated to shed light on all the relevant dimensions that are needed to provide the right starting conditions for robust economic growth within - but not exclusive to - manufacturing. In the remainder of this section we move on to provide a clear conceptual framework on what is meant by industry 4.0 and how it is integrated with digital manufacturing technologies with particular focus on developing countries. We then move on to discuss a way to measure and identify different kinds of productivity growth dynamics. 2.2.2 Adoption of new technologies in manufacturing Within the policy debate, many countries are orienting their industrial strategies and policies towards the adoption of technologies associated with the fourth wave of industrial innovation in the hopes that these new technologies can boost economic performance through increased productivity and by opening new markets. First, we take a look at what this wave of new digital technology in manufacturing actually entails and how it might affect developing economies. We first define some concepts: The focus of this part is to identify how new digital technologies enter into the domain of manufacturing: It is in the intersection of the latest technology emerging in the digital and production technologies and manufacturing production process. We refer to this domain as the smart factory which is populated by a very particular set of production technologies and concepts; see Figure 2.2 for more information. Figure 2.2: New technologies and advanced manufacturing. At the same time it is important to recognise that digital technologies have had a long and successful past within the domain of manufacturing already and are not limited to the latest wave of digital technology. This is an important insight: industry 4.0 refers to a number of particular types of digital technology but not to all digital technology. This point is illustrated in Figure 2.3 which visualises the progression from analogue production towards smart, digital technologies: Starting from analogue production, processes have become more integrated while also having moved from partial use of digital and ICT technologies;12 see also Table 2.1 for more details on the kinds of production technologies in manufacturing that can be associated with each of the steps of the pyramid in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Production technologies in manufacturing. What is particularly important here is that Figure 2.3 also allows us to identify a particular set of very narrowly defined concepts which can be related to (a) particular stage(s) of the digital technology pyramid. For example the domain of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing is most closely related to the smart factory stage. This is because for the large-scale production of goods through 3D printing, very specific and newly developed materials are required which belong to the technological frontier; see Figure 2.2. CAD-CAM13 technologies on the other hand allow for a large-scale computer aided production process within manufacturing but a fully integrated logistical or digital network across areas is not required. Lastly, robots govern by far the broadest domain of digital technologies. This is true as (simple) robots can be used to fulfil very rudimentary tasks with little to no complexity in rigid production process; however (smart) robots also form a central building block for smart factories. It is because of this complexity that we will pay very close attention to the adoption of robots and robot technology in one of the later parts of this tool. Table 2.1: What kinds of production technologies in manufacturing can be associated with each step of the pyramid in Figure 2.3? Technology generation Description 0.0 Analogue production No digital technologies are used throughout the whole production process (e.g. personal contact with suppliers or via phone; use of machinery that is not micro-electronic based) 1.0 Rigid production The use of digital technologies is limited to a specific purpose in a specific function and activity (e.g. use of CAD only in product development; use of non-integrated machines operating in isolation) 2.0 Lean production Digital technologies involve and connect different functions and activities within the firm (e.g. use of CAD-CAM linking up product development and production processes; basic automation) 3.0 Integrated production Digital technologies are integrated across different activities and functions, allowing for the interconnection of the whole production process (e.g. use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems; fully ‘paperless’ electronic production control system; industrial and service robots) 4.0 Smart Factory Digital technologies allow for fully integrated, connected, and smart production processes, where information flows across operations and generates real-time feedback to support decision-making processes (e.g. digital twins; real-time sensors and machine-to-machine communication; collaborative robots (cobots); management decision making supported by with big data and artificial intelligence support) Note: Source: UNIDO (2020). But before we will take a look at robot technology in particular, it is important to understand that these three components are related to a much broader conceptual framework of goods: As Figure 2.4 shows, the three goods constitute what we refer to as industry 4.0 goods, and themselves are again part of the much broader group of that of capital goods. This is an important insight as capital goods are of high relevance for a positive development path of the manufacturing industry (Howitt and Aghion 1998; Jorgenson 1963; Williamson 1971). Therefore, considering the three dimensions in Figure 2.4 jointly, we can empirically evaluate the intensity with which countries govern a particular domain of capital goods and where that would place them relative to global benchmarking cases. Whereas it will not be a surprise if a country which is leading in the development and distribution of additive manufacturing technology will also do well in other industry 4.0 goods, assessing the intensity of a particular developing country will certainly be more informative. Figure 2.4: The family of capital goods. Successful adoption of production technology in the context of this tool means using all forms of capital goods in the manufacturing production process; be it for producing consumer goods, intermediates or other capital goods. A simple way of finding out if firms use technology in this way on an aggregate level is to look at trade flows. As discussed above, machines - and the technology they represent - are often times imported as a first step of the adoption process. In order to determine if countries are ‘users’ (importers) or ‘producers’ (exporters) of such production technology, this tool develops a framework that will help policy makers in making this judgement. This tool also introduces a simple way that allows for a straightforward way to compare these dynamics across countries. We will classify a country as ‘specialized user’ of production technology if it imports more goods than the world average and as ‘specialized producer’ of production technology if it exports more than the world average. Comparing the resulting numbers of capital goods with 4.0 goods will provide important insights into how a country incorporates all vintages of production technology (capital goods) compared to goods related to the newest wave of technology (4.0 ), respectively. The analysis below will show that only a small number of countries are exporting capital goods and especially 4.0 goods above world average and are thus coined ‘specialized producers’. These are usually high income countries that are considered technology leaders overall. For the user of the tool, to put results into more perspective and to benchmark a country to its peers, we relate the classification to a country’s income group. We are also going to see that some countries change their trade behaviour over time. This makes for some interesting insights: For example, as countries become richer and more technologically developed, they decrease their imports of capital goods but increase their exports. This points to fact that they increasingly develop the production technology themselves. As our analysis will show, almost without exception (90%), countries that seem to successfully use (and produce) 4.0 goods also show this pattern with the broader group of capital goods. This confirms the idea of depicting technological waves as pyramid (Figure 2.3). There seems to be little room for skipping single steps of this technological pyramid. On average, a country needs to have a solid manufacturing base in older technologies before developing skills and capabilities to use the newest technology. 2.2.3 Robots and job loss in manufacturing Before we have conceptualised the adoption of technology through trade dynamics. Now we consider the consequences of successful integration of digital technologies as part of the manufacturing production process.14 Most new technologies come with commercial potentials such as enhancing firms’ productivity. As discussed before, while the actual displacement effect of manufacturing jobs that is due to computerisation is still subject to debate (Frey and Osborne 2017; Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn 2016; Nedelkoska and Quintini 2018), what remains indisputable is its heterogeneous effect on the workforce, the manufacturing industries and therefore also the countries themselves (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017, 2018, 2019; Aghion, Jones, and Jones 2017; Bessen and Righi 2019). In order to shed light on this dimension, we will use a robot dataset by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR 2019) to analyse the potential job loss from robot-based automation in manufacturing industries. Industrial Robots are defined as ‘an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multi-purpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications’ (IFR 2019). Robots are an integral part of the ‘smart factory’ and are source for improvements in productivity, especially when it comes to routine tasks. This is particularly important because these kind of routine tasks are especially frequent in manufacturing. However, there is an additional argument to be made. As recognised by Mayer (2018), manufacturing industries are not only frequently characterised as routine task-operated, but some of these tasks are also characterised as skill-complex. As Mayer (2018) notes, it is particularly these industries which are at high risk when firms adopt smart production technologies. This high skill complexity adds an additional economic argument of cost competitiveness to the discussion as to why firms may wish to replace high-skilled and expensive workers with new and smart technologies. This is why Mayer (2018) sees workers in some high(er)-technology manufacturing sectors more at higher risk of robot-based automation than others, say, lower-technology industries where automatisation rather than computerisation is expected to have the most adverse employment effects. In other words, countries with a severely under-developed manufacturing sector, and potentially a more (non-industrialized) agricultural configuration of the economy, are potentially not very likely to expect much automation-induced unemployment because of the emergence of improvements in production processes in the medium to high-technology industries. We will combine the number of robots per worker with the relative size of the relevant sectors and the degree to which there might be already some saturation or maturity in the use of robots for some countries and sectors. We will pair these insights with that of the evolution of the degree of robotisation, i.e. the replacement of employees with industry robots, to obtain a clear few on the potential danger - as well as the severity of the replacement effect - a country may face in the context of industrial robotisation. The dimension analysed for this purpose are: The share of high risk industries (where worker replacement with smart robots is both technologically and economically feasible and desirable as argued by Mayer (2018)); only a relatively ‘high’ share of these industries would constitute a risk-prone industry configuration. The relative size of manufacturing employment in total employment; only a relatively ‘high’ share will indicate that a large share of the employed population may be at risk of losing their jobs to smart digital robots. The proportion of robots to employees within manufacturing; only if there are few robots relative to the number of employees a meaningful displacement effect may occur.15 The degree at which robots are replacing workers; only if there is an active replacement of workers with robots, employees may indeed be at risk of losing their jobs. We capture this dimension by looking at the number as well as the growth rate of the number of robots per worker as the replacement risk depends on how many jobs have already been replaced as well as the pace at which this is happening.16 From the above it should become obvious that these four different dimensions can allow us to develop a detailed insight into country-specific dynamics as we will highlight in the analytical part of this tool. 2.2.4 Productivity As elaborated before, new technologies will only be adopted into the production process if they pay off, that is increase the productivity of production processes and will consequently also affect macroeconomic variables such as value added or employment. In order to analyse this dimension of the technology puzzle, we first have to find a good and accessible way to measure productivity. After that, we can analyse productivity dynamics within manufacturing industries and also consider their differences on the industry level as well as across countries. The central measure of productivity in this tool is that of labour productivity which is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country. The growth rate of productivity can be approximated by the growth rate of value added generation minus the growth rate of employment as illustrated in the formula below: \\[ growth(Labour~Productivity) = growth(Value~added) - growth(Employment) \\] In simple terms, we will see an increase in productivity (a positive growth rate) if the same number of workers (employment growth of zero) generates more value added, e.g. by producing more goods, (a positive value added growth rate). Conversely, if one requires more employees to produce the same amount of value added, then the measured degree of productivity would have gone down (negative growth). Consequently, it is important to note that we will only see positive growth rates in all three aggregates if (and only if) \\(growth(Value~added) &gt; growth(Employment)\\). 2.2.4.1 The concept of ‘runner industries’ These simple fundamentals can be visualised in Figure 2.5, which illustrates the complex nature of productivity growth dynamics an economy might face: Exemplarily, positive productivity growth can either be brought about by a positive and higher growth of value added and also positive employment growth (also referred to as ‘runner industries’) as well as positive value added and negative employment growth to which we will also refer as ‘jobless growth’. Figure 2.5: Visualisation of the runner industry concept. From this it should become clear that not all forms of productivity growth are equally desirable; nor are all forms of a decline in productivity growth equally bad. The concept of runner industries can help policy makers identify the nature of the structural dynamics of particular manufacturing industries. As will be discussed in due course, the identification of runner industries can be undertaken for different time periods and one may arrive at different results as a consequence of that. As will be illustrated in Appendix B results like these are by no means contradictory but can constitute important tools which can be used to fully understand the potential trajectory of an industry. 2.2.4.2 The concept of ‘runner industry exposure’ After having identified the set of runner industries with a particularly positive performance patterns, it is interesting and important for policy makers to know how much of their economy follows a sustainable growth path in employment and productivity. We will capture this dimension through the analysis of runner industry exposure. For this we look at the contribution (share) of runner industries in manufacturing of a particular country. From a policy perspective, the analysis of the share of runners constitutes precious information for policy makers: First of all because the runner industry classification allows policy makers to identify jobless growth dynamics as part of the conceptual toolbox. If the uptake of industry 4.0 will be successful in a particular country (and more generally, if that country will be able to increase its production productivity either through capital deepening or other channels), a low share of runners flags a higher vulnerability to undesirable employment dynamics. In other words, this means that countries are more exposed to industries where inclusive and tenable growth was not achieved. Secondly, identification of such outcomes may call for a special attention of the policy maker potentially leading to an intervention with the aim to preserve inclusive and tenable growth by also considering the country specific characteristics developed in the next section. In this sense the runner industry classification may not only serve as an assessment but also as an early-warning tool in the context of a much wider policy intervention analysis. As we see in Appendix C, the contribution of runner industries matters on a global level. As it turns out, the share of runner industries in developed countries is notably higher than in developing countries. This is important because it shows that rich countries are those showing the highest share of sectors characterized by inclusive growth, meaning productivity, employment and manufacturing value added enhancing development. Countries which became rich are the ones which were more exposed to an inclusive growth path. This is a very important message: Economic growth and the adoption of new technologies does not necessarily entail a toll in terms of growth/employment trade-off. We will also see that runner industries may include low technology and medium high-technology industries alike. The fact that rich countries are those showing a higher share of runners means that in order to reach a high-income level, countries do not have to bet on medium high-technology industries alone. As mentioned earlier, there are different ways to success and the message here seems to be that inclusive growth and within-industry structural change matters as well. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industry 4.0 debate as this latest wave of technological advancement will not create technologies that are exclusively confined to the domain of medium-high technology industry, but rather will also find their way into the lower technology segments. 2.2.5 Summary This section provides a short summary of the analytical instruments proposed in this tool. The discussion is complemented by Figure 2.6 which illustrates how the dimensions of the analysis are connected: While for industry 4.0 we focus on the adoption of new technology and the effect of robotisation in manufacturing. Figure 2.6: Visualisation of dimension of analysis As far as the productivity domain is concerned, we have highlighted the connection between robotisation, high technology and runner industries (linking industry 4.0 technology with productivity) and highlighted that countries with the highest runner exposure share, i.e. advanced economies, are the ones that are most dominant in the trade and creation of advanced manufacturing technologies. As we will see in the empirical part, there is very high correspondence between the dimension of industry 4.0 (and new technologies as a whole) and that of productivity: The industries that are identifiable as having a higher risk of robotisation after Mayer (2018), by and large also belong to the set of industries that are categorised as medium- high-technology by the OECD (2011). Most interestingly, this classification of this medium- high-technology separation builds on the R&amp;D expenditures of the particular industries. This means that these industries are the ones that have most strongly put resources into the development of new and the refinement of already existing technologies. From the earlier discussion, the overlap between these industries and the most AI-driven sectors (Calvino et al. 2018; Vincent, Vertesy, and Damioli 2019) should also be obvious. Have these technologically more engaged industries been the ones that have most significantly been affected by employment displacement? As discussed before, industry 4.0 technologies may most certainly impose a challenge for policy makers in the future, automatisation has itself always been a central component of the manufacturing process, and it has particularly been of the utmost importance for capital-intensive industries of high(er) technological sophistication. With the concept of runner industries we can easily and conveniently quantify the characteristics of these industries: Have these industries experienced the most significant reduction of employment because of automatisation? Or have these industries not only displaced workers but also created new jobs as a consequence of their technological advancement? As our runner analysis will show, the latter has been the case: There is notable overlap between more R&amp;D-heavy industries and runner industries. While it is also true that is typically this group of industries that has to some extent be highlighted by Mayer (2018) to be at higher risk of computerisation, it is the same set of industries that has shown to pursue a To this end, the golden thread of ‘creation through destruction’ not only sews together the empirical analysis of this tool, it is also closely tied to the findings of the automation literature discussed earlier (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017, 2018, 2019; Aghion, Jones, and Jones 2017 among others): Technological advancements are very likely to increase social inequality in the short run; however, it also creates the conditions under which this force is enough to restore stable equality in the long run. Consequently, policy makers need not only be made aware of these dynamics, they are also to be given the right tools to assess and tackle the challenges that come with the latest revolution of smart digital technologies.

If a country has fallen behind in terms of adoption rate, what could constitute a sensible target for the country to catch up to? How does a country’s industrial automation capacity respond to the newly emerging technologies? How can we asses if a country’s industrial automation capacity has improved? To what extent are manufacturing jobs in the country at risk of robot-based automation? What are the productivity growth dynamics of a particular industry and what do they depend on? Are positive productivity growth rates always good? Are there industries that provide positive growth and employment prospective even during the most recent periods of global market integration and fast-paced technological advancements? What is the exposure of a country to industries that have experienced positive employment, value added and productivity growth in the past? How does the share of these industries evolve over time? The main data sources are UN Comtrade (2019) for data on imports and exports of goods, UN INDSTAT (2019) for data on employment and value added on the sectoral level, the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI 2019) for a country’s total employment, population and nominal gross domestic product and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR 2019) for the stock of industrial robots. For manufacturing employment and total employment, the reader can alternatively use data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO 2019). This alternative is discussed in the appendix. In this section the index \\(i\\) refers to a country, \\(j\\) refers to an industry, \\(k\\) denotes a product or product group, while \\(t\\) denotes a time period (usually a year). 3.1 Adoption of new technologies As technology is one main driver of economic development by increasing productivity, we are interested at what stage of adoption a country currently is. If it is, for example, a leader in technology we would expect it to also be an exporter of the respective goods related to that technology. This is one way of determining if a country successfully adopted some technology, when it reached a point where it is even an exporter of it. To become a technology leader, most countries first start by importing technology to adopt it and absorb it. We begin by looking at import and export shares of the broadest category of relevant goods, capital goods and subsequently, we analyse goods related to industry 4.0. That is, we start with goods related to all vintages of technology and then focus on goods related to the latest wave of innovation. We then combine information on imports and exports to determine the stage of technology adoption of a particular country. 3.1.1 Import share of capital goods Starting with capital goods, we are interested in how much capital goods are imported compared to a country’s total imports. This should be a first indication on the ability of a country to use these goods and the technology related to them. Main question Of all the goods imported by a country, how much are capital goods? For a given country \\(i\\) and period \\(t\\), we calculate the indicator \\[ Share~of~capital~goods~imports~in~total~imports_{it} = \\frac{Imports_{ikt}}{Total~imports_{it}} \\] which tells us how much of all goods imported are capital goods. Data sources The data sources for this indicator are provided in Table 3.1. Imports are taken from UN Comtrade (2019), whereas the database offers different classification of goods. We chose ‘BEC’ as it is a classification that defines broad economic categories, such as capital goods we are interested in (United Nations Trade Statistics 2003). For a more detailed description of the ‘BEC’ classification, see H in the appendix. Table 3.1: Adoption of technologies embodied in capital goods Indicator Variable Source Share of capital goods imports in total imports Imports of capital goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total imports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC 3.1.2 Export share of capital goods While imports can indicate the ability to use capital goods, exports show the extent to which a country is competitive enough to be able to export capital goods to the world market. Main question Of all the goods exported by a country, how much are capital goods? For a given country \\(i\\) and period \\(t\\), we calculate the indicator \\[ Share~of~capital~goods~exports~in~total~exports_{it} = \\frac{Exports_{ikt}}{Total~exports_{it}} \\] which tells us how much of all goods exported are capital goods. Data sources The data sources for this indicator are provided in Table 3.2. Exports are taken from UN Comtrade (2019) where we again chose the ‘BEC’ classification. Table 3.2: Export of capital goods Indicator Variable Source Share of capital goods exports in total exports Exports of capital goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total exports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC 3.1.3 Revealed comparative advantage of imports and exports of capital goods As the simple share is a first very broad indicator of potential technology adoption by importing, we have to go further in order to establish if a country is adopting through imports or if it is already producing goods themselves. For this we first want to see if a country is importing more or less than the world average. We relate the import share from above to the import share of capital goods in worldwide imports. This indicator is called ‘revealed comparative advantage (of imports)’ RCA. If this indicator is above one, the country imports relatively more capital goods than the average country. Main question Is a country importing more or less capital goods compared to the worldwide average? \\[ RCA~import~of~a~country_{ikt} = \\frac{Imports_{ikt}}{Total~imports_{it}} / \\frac{Imports_{wkt}}{Total~imports_{wt}} \\] \\(Imports_{wkt}\\) denotes world imports of capital goods, while \\(Total~imports_{wt}\\) represents total world imports of all goods. Data sources Table 3.3: RCA import of capital goods Indicator Variable Source RCA import of a country Imports of capital goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total imports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total imports of capital goods in the world UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total imports from the world UN Comtrade (2019) BEC 3.1.4 Revealed comparative advantage of exports of capital goods Once we know if a country imports more or less than the world average, we can combine this information with the export side. If we, for example, find that a country imports less than the world average, but export more than the world average, the difference must be produced domestically. This would highlight that this country has adopted technology well enough to be able to export it. Main question Is a country exporting more or less capital goods compared to the worldwide average? \\[ RCA~export~of~a~country_{ikt} = \\frac{Exports_{ikt}}{Total~exports_{it}} / \\frac{Exports_{wkt}}{Total~exports_{wt}} \\] Data sources The data sources are the same as above, UN Comtrade (2019) in the BEC classification. Table 3.4: RCA export of capital goods Indicator Variable Source RCA export of a country Exports of capital goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total exports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total exports of capital goods to the world UN Comtrade (2019) BEC Total export to the world UN Comtrade (2019) BEC There is, however, an additional interpretation that we must not forget. A country can be a below-average exporter of capital goods. This does not mean that this country has not yet successfully adopted the related technology. It might mean that it uses the imported capital goods to produce other goods and it might even export them. Not every successful technology adopter becomes an exporter of capital goods. In simple terms: not all machines (and the technology embedded in them) are used to produce other machines. We will, however, see in the analysis part of the module that different income groups of countries show distinct patterns respectively. 3.1.5 Import share of 4.0 goods The previous indicators introduced a way of analysing imports and exports of capital goods, goods that represent every form and wave of technology. Now, we want to be more specific and look at goods that are related to industry 4.0. We start with imports and then calculate RCAs for imports and exports. Main question Of all the goods imported by a country, how much are 4.0 goods? For a given country \\(i\\) and period \\(t\\), we calculate the indicator \\[ Share~of~industry~4.0~goods~imports~in~total~imports_{it} = \\frac{Imports_{ikt}}{Total~imports_{it}} \\] Data sources The data sources for this indicator are provided in Table 3.5. This time we use the UN Comtrade (2019) with the HS 2002 classification as we are now interest in particular products. The specific list of products is based on Lavopa (2019) and can be found in Table F.1. Table 3.5: Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies Indicator Variable Source Share of industry 4.0 goods imports in total imports Imports of 4.0 goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 Total imports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 3.1.6 Export share of 4.0 goods Equivalently to above, we also calculate the exports of 4.0 goods as share of total exports. Main question Of all the goods exported by a country, how much are 4.0 goods? For a given country \\(i\\) and period \\(t\\), we calculate the indicator \\[ Share~of~industry~4.0~goods~exports~in~total~exports_{it} = \\frac{Exports_{ikt}}{Total~exports_{it}} \\] Data sources The data sources for this indicator are provided in Table 3.6. Table 3.6: Exports of industry 4.0 technologies Indicator Variable Source Share of industry 4.0 goods imports in total imports Imports of 4.0 goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 Total imports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 3.1.7 Revealed comparative advantage of imports of 4.0 goods Such as before, we are interested in the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) of imports. This time, we look at 4.0 goods. Main question Is a country importing more or less 4.0 goods compared to the worldwide average? \\[ RCA~import~of~a~country_{ikt} = \\frac{Imports_{ikt}}{Total~imports_{it}} / \\frac{Imports_{wkt}}{Total~imports_{wt}} \\] where \\(Imports_{wkt}\\) denote world imports of 4.0 goods, while \\(Total~imports_{wt}\\) represents total world imports. Data sources Data sources are again UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002. Table 3.7: RCA import of industry 4.0 goods Indicator Variable Source RCA import of a country Imports of 4.0 goods of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 Total imports of a country UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 Total imports of 4.0 goods in the world UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 Total imports from the world UN Comtrade (2019) HS 2002 3.1.8 Revealed comparative advantage of exports of 4.0 goods As with capital goods, we also look at exports in order to determine if a country is a leader in 4.0 related technology. Main question Is a country exporting more or less 4.0 goods compared to the worldwide average? \\[ RCA~export~of~a~country_{ikt} = \\frac{Exports_{ikt}}{Total~exports_{it}} / \\frac{Exports_{wkt}}{Total~exports_{wt}} \\] Data sources Data source is again UN Comtrade (2019) in the HS 2002 classification as we are interested in specific goods (Table F.1).

Please keep in mind, that this is one way of reaching such a conclusion. It is, however, a good way as trade flows ‘reveal’ the behaviour of firms from which we want to make the conclusion. We will classify countries according to their trade patterns, e.g. whether they are above or below average importers or exporters. Box 3.1: Alternative identification and disaggregation All shares that are discussed above could alternatively be calculated as shares in production by using nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in the denominator instead of total imports or exports. Nominal GDP is available from the World Bank’s ‘World Development Indicators’ (WDI 2019). The resulting indicator can act as a second benchmark when policy makers try to assess if they import more or less than comparator countries. If a country’s import share in general is higher than their peers, looking at imports of 4.0 goods in total imports could understate the expenditures in this product group. Further, it should be clear that the indicators above can be applied to more disaggregate data, for example to specific goods, such as CAD-CAM or robotics. This would potentially reveal countries’ specialisation in very particular technologies or goods. 3.2 Robots and job loss in manufacturing An important discussion with every new technological revolution is the question of whether it will substitute labour. One of the main public discussion is about job loss due to robot-based automation. Before we can make statements about potential risks of the newest technology, we need indicators that capture the use of robots, as well as how many people are potentially at risk of being replaced. To this end, we will combine the indicators described below. Box 3.2: Recommendation on aggregated employment measure This section uses manufacturing employment at the aggregated sector level (for manufacturing as a whole) as well as employment figures on the industry-level within manufacturing following the ISIC rev. 3 classification. While we resort to INDSTAT (2019) data for the industry-level analysis, it is recommended to use ILO (2019) data when analysing the manufacturing-sector aggregate. In what follows, we introduce both data sources and illustrate that there are only marginal qualitative differences across both data sources. 3.2.1 Robot intensity Robots are used as complements or substitutes for human labour. Instead of using absolute stocks, we define robot intensity as the stock of robots per manufacturing employment. If this number is increasing, more robots are used for the same amount of human labour (or the same number of robots with less humans). In order to distinguish the two possible interpretations we well later also look at the development of employment. Main question How many industrial robots are used compared to manufacturing employees? \\[ Robot~intensity~within~manufacturing_{it} = \\frac{Industrial~robot~operational~stock_{it}}{Manufacturing~employment_{it}} \\] Data sources Data sources for this indicator are the IFR (IFR 2019) for the stock of industrial robots used in all manufacturing industries and the ILO (2019) for employment in all manufacturing industries. Table 3.9: Robot intensity in a country Indicator Variable Source Robot intensity within manufacturing Industrial robot operational stock used by all industries IFR (2019), World Robotics Manufacturing employment ILO (2019) or UN INDSTAT (2019) 3.2.2 Growth rate of robot intensity In order to be able to see, if the robot intensity increases or decreases over time, it can help to calculate annual growth rates.This number shows by how much robot intensity increases or decreases from one year to the next. We will use it in the empirical analysis below to see that some countries show signs of maturity or saturation. That is, low annual growth rates indicating that the number of robots per worker does not increase significantly anymore. This has to be taken into account in order to assess the risk of automation. Main question By how much did the robot intensity grow or shrink per year? \\[ Annual~growth~rate~of~robot~intensity_{it} = \\frac{End~value_{it} - Initial~value_{it}}{Initial~value_{it}} \\] 3.2.3 Robot intensity by industry Robots are used in different industries to varying degrees. Some sectors use more, some very few robots compared to employees. In order to see, how countries use robots in different industries over time, we calculate robot intensity by industry. Main question How many industrial robots are used compared to manufacturing employees in different industries? \\[ Robot~intensity~within~manufacturing_{ijt} = \\frac{Industrial~robot~operational~stock_{ijt}}{Manufacturing~employment_{ijt}} \\] Data sources Data sources for this indicator are the IFR (IFR 2019) for the stock of industrial robots for a specific industry and the UN INDSTAT (2019) for employment of that industry. Table 3.10: Robot intensity in a country by industry Indicator Variable Source Robot intensity within manufacturing Industrial robot operational stock of an industry IFR (2019), World Robotics Manufacturing employment of same industry UN INDSTAT (2019) 3.2.4 Share of employees in risk industries Now that we have indicators for the use of robots per employee, we can start to answer the question if and by how much workers are at risk of losing their job due to robot-based automation. Arguably, not every type of work is at the same risk of being replaced by a machine. Mayer (2018) has identified four manufacturing sectors, in which this risk is particularly high. We call them ‘risk sectors’ and they are Chemicals, Rubber and Plastic, Electronics as well as the automotive industry. Please look to Section 5.1.2 for a detailed discussion. We will first see what share of employees works in ‘risk industries’ Main question What is the share of workers in risk industries in total manufacturing employment? \\[ Share~of~employment~at~risk~in~total~manufac._{it} = \\frac{Manufac.~employment~in~risk~industries_{ijt}}{Total~manufacturing~employment_{it}} \\] Data sources Data sources (Table 3.11) is UN INDSTAT (2019) for sectoral employment. Table 3.11: Share of employment in risk sectors Indicator Variable Source Share of employment at risk in total manufacturing Manufacturing employment in risk industries: electronics, automotive and rubber UN INDSTAT (2019) Total manufacturing employment ILO (2019) or UN INDSTAT (2019) 3.2.5 Share of manufacturing employment in total employment Next, we calculate the share of workers in the manufacturing industries in total employment. This indicates one dimension of importance of the manufacturing sector for an economy. If the manufacturing sector as a whole is small, then automation might affect fewer people. Main question What is the share of workers working in the manufacturing industry compared to total employment in a country? \\[ Share~of~manufac.~employment~in~total~employment_{it} = \\frac{Total~manufacturing~employment_{it}}{Total~employment_{it}} \\] Data sources Data sources (Table 3.12) are UN INDSTAT (2019) for industry employment and the World Bank’s ‘World Development Indicators’ (WDI 2019) for a countries total employment. Table 3.12: Share of manufacturing employment Indicator Variable Source Share of manufacturing employment in total employment Total manufacturing employment ILO (2019) or UN INDSTAT (2019) Total employment WDI (2019) 3.3 Productivity The analysis of productivity related dynamics is built on two consecutive steps. In Step 1 the three central variables of the analysis (productivity, employment, value added) are used to analyse industry-level growth dynamics and follow an inclusive and tenable growth trajectory (a positive growth rate of value added, employment and productivity). Throughout the analysis we refer to these industries as ‘runners’ (or runner industries). In Step 2, we assess the share of runner industries relative to the manufacturing sector of a country. This way we can quantify the proportion of a country’s manufacturing industry characterized by positive productivity, value added and employment dynamics. See Table 3.13 for a list of relevant variables. Throughout this section we will only resort to INDSTAT (2019) data. Table 3.13: Structure of analysis Indicator Variable Step 1: Identification of runner industries Productivity CAGR Employment CAGR Value added CAGR Step 2: Runner industry exposure Value added share of runner sub-sector Employment share of runner sub-sector 3.3.1 Identification of runner industries Strategic questions and data sources What are the productivity growth dynamics of a particular industry and what do they depend on? Are positive productivity growth rates always good? Are there industries that provide positive growth and employment prospective even during the most recent periods of global market integration and fast-paced technological advancements? The indicators used for this analysis are the sub-sector value added and employment series from INDSTAT (2019) both of which are used to calculate the third indicator (productivity) as described in Table 3.14. Table 3.14: Data Sources for identification of inclusive and tenable industry growth Indicator Variable Source Employment growth rate Sub-sector employment-to-population compound annual growth rate (CAGR) UN INDSTAT (2019) Value added growth rate Sub-sector value added per capita (VA) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) UN INDSTAT (2019) Productivity growth rate Sub-sector productivity growth rate (CAGR) (calculated based on variables above) Methodological underpinnings of runner identification analysis The purpose of this step is to illustrate the effect of (changes in) productivity dynamics and how they relate to economy-wide performance patterns. The subsequent analysis is conducted on the basis of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) which is calculated as \\[ CAGR = \\frac{End~value}{Initial~value}^{1/no.~of~years} -1 \\] The CAGR corresponds to a smoothed annual average over the time horizon considered. It serves as a measure to illustrate how much a particular variable has grown over time. In the case of this tool, we are interested in learning about the growth rates of employment, value added as well as productivity: Productivity is defined as the ratio of value added creation over the employment head count. In other words, it measures how much value added (in monetary terms) is produced by each employee of a respective industry in one year. Whereas this measure is interesting, the focus of this module is to assess the dynamics of productivity changes over time. This allows one to better assess the speed and direction of changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing industries of a country. Please note that it is preferable to calculate productivity and value added growth rates based on real value added series. This is because nominal value added growth is a composition of the growth rates of real value added and that of prices, i.e. inflation. Calculating nominal value added growth rates could therefore result in unrealistically high (nominal) growth rates which are simply the result of high inflation. Obviously, this is not desirable. In Appendix E we propose a simple and straightforward measure to calculate real value added series for manufacturing industries. Based on this formula one can calculate CAGRs for productivity, value added and employment. As discussed in Section 2.2.4, some combinations of growth rates of these three variables are more desirable than others. In Chapter 6.1 we will focus on the analysis of industries that follow a positive value added as well as productivity growth, i.e. can be classified as runner industries. 3.3.2 Runner industry exposure Strategic questions and data sources What is the exposure of a country to industries that have experienced positive employment, value added and productivity growth in the past? How does the share of these industries evolve over time? The variables necessary to calculate runner industry exposure shares are listed in Table 3.15. Table 3.15: Indicators for identification of exposure to runner industries Indicator Variable Source Runner value added share Manufacturing value added of runner sub-sector UN INDSTAT (2019) Total manufacturing value added UN INDSTAT (2019) Runner employment share Manufacturing employment of runner sub-sector UN INDSTAT (2019) Total manufacturing employment UN INDSTAT (2019) The shares for value added and employment are then calculated as \\[ Runner~value~added~share_{it} = \\frac{Value~added~runner~industry_{it}}{Total~manufacturing~value~added_{it}} \\] \\[ Runner~employment~share_{it} = \\frac{employment~runner~industry_{it}}{Total~manufacturing~employment_{it}} \\] In the two equations above \\(Total~manufacturing~value~added_{it}\\) and \\(Total~manufacturing~employment_{it}\\) refer to the sum of value added and/or employment over all available industries on the basis of the previously calculated data series. In other words, both denominators are not obtained from the pre-aggregated manufacturing sector series. References "],
["analysis.html", "Section 4 Analysis 1 4.1 Adoption of new technologies", " Section 4 Analysis 1 4.1 Adoption of new technologies When it comes to the generation of new technologies, economies can either create these themselves or import them. It has been widely established in economic research that the latter is more common.17 Consequently, it makes sense to investigate the trade dynamics between economies, i.e. import and export flows. Different speeds and intensities of technology adoption across countries and over time can be highlighted this way. However, it must be stressed that the mere adoption of new technologies through importation does not guarantee the local absorption and diffusion. For this to be a successful strategy, preconditions that create a growth-enabling environment of a country matter:18 The most recent Industrial Development Report (UNIDO 2020) also focuses on industry 4.0 with new firm level data. It stresses the necessity of certain pre-requisites in order for firms being able to successfully adopt new (digital) technology. They range from institutional and infrastructure capabilities such as energy supply and connectivity, to production and technological capabilities such as skilled staff that can handle machines and software, to changes in a firm’s culture such as the acceptance of more automation in the production process. Importing technology can additionally strengthen these capabilities as there are learning processes related to trade. These can come from cooperation with universities or foreign partners, or from reverse engineering, just to name a few. For the purpose of the analysis of this tool a heterogeneous group of countries is considered. This group consists of a set of advanced economies (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea), all of which are big players in the adoption and generation of new technologies; see Appendix A. The list of countries is complemented by a group of emerging economies (China, the Russian Federation as well as Viet Nam and Georgia). These countries have been selected with the purpose to illustrate particular development patterns observed in the adoption strategies of industry 4.0 technologies. As we have seen in the previous discussion, industry 4.0 technologies are a sub-group of capital goods. Whereas the former identify cutting-edge technologies one is most likely to find in modern, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, capital goods cover a much broader domain. Capital goods are machinery and other manufactured goods which are used by industry, government and non-profit private institutions. They are in fact producers’ goods that are defined as part of fixed capital formation (United Nations Trade Statistics 2003). Capital goods form one of the central building blocks of a healthy and growing manufacturing sector: Economic research has demonstrated that manufacturing provides great potential for positive growth trajectories through its scalability and high degree of capital accumulation, both of which can be identified through the utilisation of capital goods. Consequently, the analysis begins on the level of the capital goods group which can be understood to represent both the latest as well as already more established production technologies. Then, the same tools are applied for the sub-group of industry 4.0 goods that allow to identify industry 4.0-specific dynamics.This is done with the goal to provide a simple tool for policy makers to analyse and categorise where their own economy stands relative to other economies and the global level, both in the utilisation of capital goods as well as industry 4.0 technology as part of the domestic production process. It will become clear that different income groups of countries (high income, upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income) show some distinct trade patterns when it comes to imports and exports of production technology. 4.1.1 Capital goods The first graph (Figure 4.1) shows shares of imports of capital goods in all goods (indicator 3.1) between 2002 and 2017. Considering the whole time period, only the Russian Federation increased its import share significantly. What might be surprising, is that there is no clear division between high-income countries and the others. For example, Japan as well as Georgia had decreasing shares until the middle of the last decade when shares started to increase again. On the one hand, decreasing import shares can mean that relatively fewer capital goods are imported because a country is able to produce them domestically. On the other hand, increasing import shares can show that a country is increasingly able to use goods that are related to some technology. Figure 4.1: Share of capital goods imports in total imports While imports can highlight users of production technologies, exports show producers (indicator 3.2). Figure 4.2: Share of capital goods exports in total exports Figure 4.2 makes clear that there are countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany or China where capital goods make up one third of their total exports, while others such as the Russian Federation or Georgia decreased their shares of capital goods in exports. Viet Nam seems to have transformed into an exporter in the last ten to fifteen years. Since the numbers represent production technology of all vintages, we cannot yet see who the technology leaders are in terms of new technological advancements. This will be done by inspecting imports and exports of 4.0 goods below. An immediate question arising from this initial analysis is how policy makers can obtain a benchmark relating country performance patterns to global dynamics. We propose two indicators to facilitate this requirement: By calculating the import shares relative to the world average (indicator 3.3), one can quantify the import performance of a country in relation to the global average. This relation is called ‘revealed comparative advantage’ (RCA). If a country is characterized by an import RCA larger than one, this means that it imports more than the world average. In turn, this could point to a faster adoption of technology for countries that are not yet at the technological frontier. In that sense, the RCA of imports (indicator 3.3) is strongly connected to the adoption rate (indicator 3.1) as both indicators depend on the share of capital goods in total imports. The same overall import profiles will show across countries with both indicators but the interpretation changes as RCA is a relative measure. As the second indicator, RCA exports (indicator 3.4), serves as a key measure to detect the local capabilities of countries in producing capital goods. As before, if a country is characterized by an RCA (export) larger than 1, it exports more than the global average. This means that it has acquired capabilities to export sophisticated and technology-intensive goods and is competitive on the global stage. Figure 4.3: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of capital goods An interesting picture emerges from the figure above. Figure 4.3 displays if countries import or export more or less than the world average. When this information is combined, a story about technology adoption that is based on ‘revealed’ trade flows can be told. Let us look at examples to make this clear: The Russian Federation is the only country in our sample that clearly imports more capital goods over time than the world average (upper graph); while it also exports much less than the world average (lower graph). This points to the fact that the Russian Federation uses capital goods and technologies that come with them in their production process but they are not above-average exporters. This is either because (i) they have not yet adopted and absorbed the technology to an extent that allows them to become exporters of capital goods or (ii) they produce only for the domestic market or (iii) they use the production technology to produce and export other (non-capital) goods. Similar to the Russian Federation, Georgia shows low export exposure compared to the world average. However, they also do not import significantly more capital goods than the world average. This most likely points to the fact that Georgia is not yet able to adopt all the technologies that are associated with capital goods. The rest of the countries show a relatively similar evolution. Over time, they import less capital goods than the world average. While China decreased its share continuously, the others are relatively stable across the years. At the same time, they export more than the world average. This implies that these countries have to produce capital goods themselves. This is another indicator of successful technology adoption, in the sense that they no longer need to import production technology but have become producers. On the basis of the indicators shown we can create a classification of the following sort. RCA import RCA export Group &lt; 1 &gt; 1 specialized producer &gt; 1 &gt; 1 specialized producer and user &gt; 1 &lt; 1 specialized user &lt; 1 &lt; 1 non-specialized Here, ‘specialized producer’ indicates a country with an import RCA of below (or close to) one and an export RCA greater than one. These countries have a revealed comparative advantage in exporting goods (but not in importing) and are typically the ones closest to the technology frontier. Next up are economies which are ‘specialized producers and users’ which have a comparative advantage in both importing and in exporting. Here it is important to emphasise that, despite the fact that they have an import and export RCA greater than one, most likely they do not import the same set of goods as they export. This means that if such a country is identified for, say, capital goods, it makes sense to ‘dig deeper’ and look at what kind of capital goods the country imports and exports. Most likely this is where some differences can be identified: A country may be a strong exporter for some groups of goods, while it may still be an importer when it comes to the adoption of the latest available technology. We can see this through the analysis of RCAs of industry 4.0 goods below. China is an example that, in the beginning of the period, showed a pattern as described but continuously decreased its share in capital goods imports. The third group, which consists of ‘specialized users’, are countries with an import RCA bigger than one and an export RCA smaller than one. These are the countries that typically try to adopt new technology through imports and absorption. The Russian Federation is an example in our sample. Lastly, with both RCAs below one, these countries are non-specialized, at least not yet. This classification of countries based on trade flows of capital goods can help policy makers, first, to evaluate if they are users or producers of production technology. Second, it can act as a benchmarking exercise in technology adoption because the classification is very much related to income groups defined by the World Bank (2019). Figure 4.4 illustrates very clearly that, on average, there is a considerable spread for the export RCAs of capital goods: High income countries have on average the highest export RCAs, followed by upper middle, lower middle and finally low income countries. As for import RCAs, we can observe that, on average, the import propensity seems to first build up as economies grow richer but decline after a country has reached the lower middle income mark. It has to be noted, however, that for all four income group aggregates, the differences are both relatively small in terms of magnitude and also well centred around the global average mark of ‘1’. Figure 4.4: RCA exports and imports for capital goods by income group For capital goods, which represent all forms of production technology, this means that the higher the income of a country, the more likely it is to be an exporter of these goods. Overall, only a relatively small fraction of countries are specialized exporters but around half of countries are specialized importers and thus users of capital goods. For more details, see Appendix I Disclaimer to classification Please note that this analysis provides a simplified means to analyse an otherwise very complex topic and any obtained classification of a particular country and year should always be considered with a grain of salt: Good knowledge of the country’s particular situation as well as the time profile of the RCAs is recommended. This is because of the following reasons. ‘Revealed’ trade patterns are used to infer adoption rates from that. Some countries, such as the United States have a large domestic market. Their share of exports of high-technology goods in their total exports might be relatively small, although the U.S. can clearly be considered a technology leader. The cut-off at ‘1’ tells a clear story in that it represents the world average of import or export shares; however, some countries might be very close to that cut-off, being above it and then below it in the next year. Especially small product groups might show high volatility (fluctuations) in the numbers resulting possibly in a misleading story. To get a complete picture, always look at the whole time series of your country of interest and also take other country specific information, you might have, into account. In our example, China and Viet Nam changed the group over the years which is an important information about their development. What is more, the exercise of calculating RCAs could alternatively be done with imports and exports as shares of nominal gross domestic product. This variant leads to very similar results as the one presented above. Also, using ‘1’ as the relevant cut-off to define the classification could be replaced by using the average of all country RCAs in imports and exports respectively. We propose to use ‘1’ as cut-off as it is simpler and does not change the main insights discussed above qualitatively when using the averages instead. 4.1.2 Adoption of industry 4.0 technologies While the numbers above concerned all capital goods, the focus now switches to 4.0 goods, goods related to additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM or robotics which are part of the ‘smart factory’. With the same method as above, it can be found out which countries are users and producers of goods related to the latest technological production processes. The following graph (Figure 4.5) shows the share of imports of 4.0 goods in total imports in percent (indicator 3.5). First, the numbers for some of the countries in the sub-sample are remarkably stable over time and they are still relatively low in absolute terms, as the smart factory is a relatively new phenomenon. We know from other research (see e.g., Lavopa (2019) or Gal et al. (2019)) that it is a small number of mostly highly productive firms that are the first that adopt new technologies generating a ‘digital capability gap’ within countries between the ‘best and the rest’. During the first decade of the century, the Russian Federation, China and Viet Nam decreased their share of imports of 4.0 goods. Beginning in 2010, with the exception of China, the rest of the subset increased their relative imports, albeit very slowly. The Russian Federation reached their 2002 level again in 2017 with slightly less than 0.6 percent of imports being 4.0 goods. As with capital goods, import shares do not seem to be related to income levels at a first glance, at least not for our sub-sample of countries. Figure 4.5: Share of 4.0 goods imports in total imports Figure 4.6: Share of 4.0 goods exports in total exports For exports of 4.0 goods (indicator 3.6), there seems to be a correlation with income for our subset. Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea seem to be the largest exporters in terms of export shares. Again, as a benchmark exercise and to interpret the shares, the following shows the revealed comparative advantage for 4.0 goods (indicators 3.7 and 3.8). Numbers above one indicate imports or exports above the world average respectively. Figure 4.7: Revealed comparative advantage, imports and exports of 4.0 goods The resulting figure allows to conclude that some countries do not yet import capital goods or 4.0 goods, while some others are importing industry 4.0 technology but have not yet moved into a leading position in these technologies which would allow them to also engage actively in exporting. Again, some others are on the way of adopting these technology, yet another group - here Japan - are technology leaders and main exporters of 4.0 goods. This analysis can be generalized to all countries and provides the following picture: Figure 4.8: RCA exports and imports for industry 4.0 goods by income group Figure 4.8 reveals, the differences across income groups seem much more pronounced. While lower income countries are more rarely engaged in industry 4.0 goods trading activities, the import RCA for upper middle income countries is by far the highest while their corresponding export RCA is only slightly higher than that of its lower income counterparts. In other words: Upper middle income countries are predominantly importing industry 4.0 technologies. High income countries on the other hand are much more balanced. It has to be noted however, that among the group of high income countries there exists a small and particularly export-led sub-group of countries (see A) that are mainly responsible for driving up the average RCA export share of the high income countries. In that sense, the information provided in this section may be seen as evidence that the progression dynamics of industry 4.0 goods are currently unfolding within the group of high income countries while they have much more clearly emerged for capital goods and across all income groups already. These first indicators provide the policy maker with an overview of a country and comparison with other countries on where they stand in terms of overall technology adoption and absorption by looking at trade patterns of capital goods as well as 4.0 goods. While Figure 4.4 and 4.8 provide some interesting insights on the evolution of classification patterns of the different income groups over time, one can furthermore derive some clear empirical evidence in favour of a technological progression that is reflected in changes of the import/export structure of capital and industry 4.0 goods as economies growth richer. An additional discussion on these fundamentals is offered in Appendix I 4.1.3 Adoption dynamics within the industry 4.0 goods The analysis above showed that, for example, Japan shows a high export exposure in both groups of goods. In order to know if Japan’s success as an exporter is based on a single technology or is more evenly spread, we can distinguish between different goods. As discussed before, 4.0 goods can be differentiated as additive manufacturing, CAD-CAM and (other) Robotics. Figure 4.9 shows the share of imports (in percent) of total imports of a country (indicator ??). Figure 4.9: Import share (%) in total imports The first observation is that import shares are very low across countries with a maximum of around 0.4 percent in 2017. This might not be surprising as these goods are among the newest generation of technological capital goods. However, countries in this sub-sample show an overall declining or stagnant share of imports in additive manufacturing or CAD-CAM. What is more, the relative position of countries did not change from the more aggregate goods above. This pattern changes, however, when one looks at Robotics where shares of imports of robots in total imports are increasing for the most part. Additionally, to study RCA as above, the user can also asses the economic importance of these imports when compared to a country’s production (indicator ??). Figure 4.10 presents imports in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This way one can show that, for example, Viet Nam imports much more 4.0 goods than the other countries in this sample, relative to their overall production. Relating imports to a country’s production can thus help give more context to import shares and indicate which goods or technologies are important numerically. Figure 4.10: Share of 4.0 goods imports in nominal GDP This chapter provided the policy maker with a set of indicators that have to be used in conjunction in order to understand technology adoption patterns. Import shares that indicate the importance of a (group of) good(s) and their potential to help in the process of technology adoption are combined with RCA of imports and exports to classify countries as being users or producers. Disaggregating the data can highlight if a country specializes in particular goods or technologies or if it lacks some of them completely. Additionally, the classification of countries together with their position in the worldwide income distribution can help policy makers in comparing their revealed comparative advantages to others. This can highlight potential strengths and weaknesses in the adoption process and points to areas of potential policy interventions. SUMMARY: How to use the concept It should be clear from the above that you need to combine all measures to get a complete picture of technology adoption with the help of trade data. To summarize: -1 Look at import and export shares (indicators 3.1, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6) of capital goods and 4.0 goods. -2 Calculate revealed comparative advantage (RCA) for imports and exports of capital goods and 4.0 goods (indicators 3.3, 3.4, 3.7 and 3.8). -3 Plot the RCAs over time (together with those of comparator countries you are interested in). -4 Interpret the findings by considering changes over time and also compare your country to the average of the same income group as a benchmark (compare Figures ?? and ??). -5 Do this analysis for more detailed products or product groups to see if the aggregate results are driven by specific goods in a particular country (e.g. indicator ??).

["analysis-2.html", "Section 5 Analysis 2 5.1 Robots and job loss in manufacturing", " Section 5 Analysis 2 5.1 Robots and job loss in manufacturing The focus shifts now on robots in particular. On the one hand, one can get more detailed insights into one product group where countries show increasing import shares (see Chapter 4.1.3). On the other hand, when jobs are being at risk of automation, it is mostly robots that come to mind. As Mayer (2018) points out, the manufacturing sector is characterised by a number of routine jobs and therefore particularly exposed to the potential substitution of labour by robots. It is important to note at the outset, that different indicators have to be combined to be able to evaluate the risk of job loss from robot-based automation. Generally speaking, we want to know (i) how many robots are already in use and how fast they are growing in numbers, (ii) how many workers are in manufacturing and specifically in industries that are characterised as ‘high risk industries’. Some countries are lost in the analysis due to data limitations of the robot dataset. 5.1.1 Robot intensity Robot intensity measures the ratio of the number of robots relative to the number of employees (indicator 3.9). On the downside, this indicator is narrowing its focus to the dimension of robots alone, whereas previous indicators were based on a broader range of industry 4.0 goods consisting of CAD - CAM, additive manufacturing and robots. Consequently, results presented in this section should always be interpreted in the context of robotics and are therefore not necessarily representative for the wider range of industry 4.0 related technologies or the wider adoption capabilities of any of the countries considered in this exercise. However, as the ‘smart factory’ is mostly about intelligently connecting machines (robots) and other parts of the production process, the use of industrial robots is a first indicator of how relevant this topic is for countries or how prepared countries are in this respect. Thus, the intensity of robots used in the production process will be calculated as the stock of industrial robots per 1 million employees. If this ratio is increasing, it can be interpreted as a measure of progress of a country’s industrial automation capacities. Figure 5.1 shows the robot intensity (indicator 3.9) over time. The vertical axis is displayed in log-form in order to see all countries in one graph.19 The figure replicates the patterns from above. Industrialised countries, such as Japan, Republic of Korea or Germany already use up to 80,000 robots per 1 million employees. On the other hand, in Viet Nam or the Russian Federation, they range below 1,000 per million employees. In total, with the exception of Japan, all selected countries show an increase in robot intensity over time. Figure 5.1: Robot intensity: robots per 1 Mio. manufacturing employees The picture is remarkably stable when disaggregated by industry (Figure 5.2) to obtain robot intensity by industry (indicator 3.10). Without exception it is the high-income countries that show a higher robot intensity over time. Also, robot-intensity shows a large variation across sectors with the highest numbers in the electronics and automotive industry. Figure 5.2: Robot intensity: robots per 1 Mio. manufacturing employees 5.1.2 Manufacturing employment risk exposure Almost all observed countries above increased their robot intensity over time. Against this background, an important dimension of the discussion surrounding new technology, are the potential benefits and risks of new technology. In the context of robots, it is the effect of robot-based automation. In a similar way to the employment composition analysis in EQuIP Tool 5: Employment Composition, the risk of manufacturing employment exposure stemming from automation can be quantified. This concept is of particular complexity as automation itself is technology-biased and more likely to affect industries (and countries) which are high in capital intensity. This makes the issue of employment risk exposure a particularly multifaceted concept which depends on numerous factors. Three main components are discussed in the remainder of this section. A recent study (Mayer 2018) identifies the manufacturing share (indicator 3.12) as a first important variable representing a threat of job destruction from industry 4.0 penetration. The argument is that the manufacturing sector is the one characterized by routine jobs and sensitive to robot/human capital substitution. Countries with a severely under-developed manufacturing sector, and potentially a more (non-industrialized) agricultural configuration of the economy, are potentially not very likely to expect much automation-induced unemployment yet because of the emergence of improvements in production processes in the medium to high-technology industries. Under the assumption of a well-developed manufacturing basis, the effect of automation-induced unemployment further depends on the industrial composition of a country’s industry. Mayer (2018) identifies a subset of manufacturing industries that are considered to be at a high-risk of automation (see Table 5.1). As he points out, “job displacement by robots in relatively skill-intensive and well-paying manufacturing, such as the automotive and electronics sectors, is more profitable than in relatively labour intensive and low-paying sectors, such as apparel” and that “economic factors are more important for robot deployment than the technical possibilities of automating workers’ tasks”. Of course this set of industries might change over time when other sectors become more skill intensive or when the technology evolves. Table 5.1: Sectors vulnerable to robot-based automation, based on Mayer (2018) ISIC Rev. 3 Industry Code Name of Industry 24 Chemicals 25 Rubber and plastic 31 Electronic appliances 34A Automobile vehicles Applying this industry classification of high-risk industries to the country sample in this module, Figure 5.3 shows the share of workers in sectors Chemicals, Rubber and Plastic, Electrical Appliances as well as Automotive Vehicles (indicator 3.11). It illustrates the notably higher exposure shares for the set of advanced economies of the sample (Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea) while the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and Georgia report a relatively low and stable trend over time. Given its dynamic growth and aspiration to become a technology leader itself, the trade-off between technological advancement and employment risk exposure becomes very obvious for the case of China: Within 10 years (between 2007 and 2017) China has increased its exposure share by around 7 percentage points and now closes in to the group of most advanced economies. Figure 5.3: Share of employees at risk of automation Robots are used in different industries to different degrees. In 2016, for the country sample, two thirds of robots were employed in Automotive and Electronics, which overlaps with the sectors identified above. There is considerable variation across countries. Germany uses robots relatively intensely producing cars compared to other industries. The Republic of Korea and Japan do so even more and additionally are robot-intensive producers of Electronics. Viet Nam, the Russian Federation or China use robots much less intensely with China relatively evenly across industries and the Russian Federation more skewed towards Automobiles and Metals. Viet Nam uses robots relatively more intensely in the production of Plastic and Chemical products. Figure 5.4: Robot intensity: robots per 1 Mio. manufacturing employees Similarly to the previous chapter, indicators have to be combined in order to get to preliminary conclusion if workers are at risk of robot-based automation. In order to do that and as one way of reaching a conclusion, we follow Mayer (2018) in looking at a large sample of 111 countries to see if a more general patterns can be identified. Figure D.2 relates average (2002-2016) risk industry employment (indicator 3.11) to total manufacturing employment (indicator 3.12). Further, we can distinguish countries by income group and by their average robot intensity (size of points, indicator 3.9). The graph can be divided into 4 quadrants. The top-left quadrant includes countries, where employment in risk industries is relatively overrepresented. For example, in Mexico 5% of all employees are in manufacturing industries. However, of those, over 30% are employed in risk industries. Countries in the top-right quadrant show a high number of manufacturing employees overall and in risk industries as well. In large parts, these are high-income and upper-income countries that already show the most intense robot use (size of symbol). Overall, countries are more at risk of job loss the larger the manufacturing sector and the more employees in ‘risk industries’. Grouping countries by income, it shows that employees in developed as well as in upper middle income countries are, on average, more exposed to risk of job loss due to automation, while least developed countries are not (yet) strongly exposed. Also, high income countries display higher robot intensities, confirming previous graphs. These findings also pose a challenging conundrum: On the one hand they are suggestive of the interpretation that robot-based automation will not invalidate the important role of industrial development for less-developed economies per se; on the other hand, the fact that the use of robots is positively correlated with more high-skilled industries may bring about an even greater challenge to less-developed countries when it comes to sectoral upgrading. Basically, countries that want to increase their high-technology industry shares might, at least temporarily, expose part of their labour to the risk of job loss due to automation. Figure 5.5: Vulnerability to robot-based automation This last observation brings us to the third factor vital to manufacturing employment risk exposure; namely that of (non-) maturity of a country’s automation tendencies. Is robot intensity growing fast or did it reach some saturation? This dimension can be analysed by comparing the growth of robot intensity of a country with the level of robot intensity (indicator 3.9). For countries with low growth rates, the actual threat of job loss related to automation is relatively low even though the risk of job-loss in the particular industry may remain high as a consequence of technological advancements. This profile puts them out of the ‘danger zone’ where technological advancements may bring about at least short-run involuntary employment disruptions. Conversely, countries which have not reached this stage of maturity yet can indeed be at risk of high robot-based automation vulnerability if they show a high growth rate in robot intensity as well as a steady increase in the stock over time.20 As is evident from Figure D.2, the findings by Mayer (2018) suggest that countries characterized by a composition of the manufacturing sector tilted towards electronics, automotive and chemical industries are more vulnerable to job displacement because there job displacement is more profitable. A higher risk of job displacement could be associated with a higher robot intensity because countries which have already adopted robot technology more extensively, are also more inclined to continue with their robotisation efforts because they already own all the necessary capabilities. However, this process is only expected to continue until countries reach a certain level of maturity in robotisation. After that point it is unlikely that countries can continue to inject robots in the production system, and they will rather try to upgrade towards higher generations of industry 4.0 including artificial intelligence, big data and CAD – CAM. Therefore, the risk of job displacement to manufacturing employment in emerging countries may be more apparent. Figure D.3 shows the annual (2002-2015) growth rate of robot intensity (indicator ??) on the Y-axis and the robot intensity (indicator 3.9) on the X-axis. Technology leaders, such as Germany and Japan, can be described as having reached a degree of maturity with a high yet very static degree of robot intensity over time. The Republic of Korea still seems to expand its robot intensity despite leading the pack already in 2014. Compared to the Russian Federation, Viet Nam and China seem to expand their relative stock of robots, albeit from a low level. This picture (as many others in this tool) can potentially change dramatically as new technology becomes available.21 Figure 5.6: Maturity effect of automation This chapter has shown that different indicators have to be combined to get a coherent picture of the automation processes. Although some industries may show a higher likelihood of replacing labour by robots, it also matters which stage (maturity) the robotisation has already reached. If a country’s goal is to increase the degree of automation in the production process, at first it might expose labour to some risk of being replaced by robots, especially in mid- to high technology sectors. Once there is some maturity effect in the adoption of robots, the risk decreases again. Policy makers must be aware of the possible necessity to ease the transition for workers in the time of upgrading. References "],
["analysis-3.html", "Section 6 Analysis 3 6.1 Productivity", " Section 6 Analysis 3 6.1 Productivity This section links the current debate on technological revolution that is due to the emergence of smart digital technology to macroeconomic indicators across manufacturing industries. The instruments presented in the following paragraphs allow for a simple analysis of the differences in the dynamics of manufacturing industry’s productivity, value added and employment growth dynamics over time. It also proposes a simple way to analyse and compare country-specific industry profiles across aggregates and over time and furthermore defines a simple forward-looking approach to identify the direction into which a particular manufacturing industry is developing. As discussed before, the concept of runner industries puts emphasis on the concept of sustained employment growth; a feature that cannot be overstated in light of the employment automation risk discussed in the context of the newly emerging technologies with smart systems and robots before. The concept of runner industries is also extended to that of runner industry exposure which constitutes a straightforward instrument to characterise the share of industries within manufacturing that feature positive productivity and employment characteristics. It is also very important to understand that the classification of runner industries, is derived from average global trends. Consequently, one should note that the idea of runner industries is not a static concept but fundamentally depends on the set of countries and time periods looked at. We will discuss these implications when talking about individual effects . The subsequent paragraphs offer a runner industries analysis for the case of Viet Nam and Morocco. We further illustrate how policy analysts can utilise the instruments provided in this tool to understand the role as well as the aim and scope of the runner industry methodology. 6.1.1 Runner industries We start the empirical analysis by identifying runner industries. Particularly through the adoption of new technologies, the importance of the identification of industries with the characteristics associated with positive value added, employment and productivity growth cannot be overstated: This set of industries has remained at the forefront of value added and employment generation and therefore stands in stark contrast to the jobless or declining growth types discussed earlier; see Figure 2.5. In order to be able to identify the corresponding regime types associated with the respective industry, employment, value added as well as productivity compound annual growth rates (\\(CAGR\\)) are to be calculated using the following steps: Retrieve data (see Table 3.14): Obtain value added and employment data from INDSTAT. Obtain population data from an alternative data source such as the World Development Indicators. Calculate series: Calculate value added per capita as well as the employment-population ratio.22 For the value added series it is necessary to eliminate any potential price effects in the series (see Appendix E for more details). Calculate productivity series as23: \\[ Productivity = Value~added~per~capita / Employent~population~ratio \\] Calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each of the three variables Do this by calculating: \\[ CAGR = \\frac{End~value}{Initial~value}^{1/no.~of~years} -1 \\] Calculate averages of the CAGRs of value added, employment and productivities for the aggregates of interest. In our case we are interested in: the global runners (taking averages of the growth rates across all countries); the income group runners (averages across all countries belonging to the same income group as Viet Nam and Morocco, i.e. lower-middle income; the runners for Viet Nam and Morocco exclusively. For the remainder of this section we will refer to global/income group and/Morocco and or Viet Nam runners as the set of runner industries that have been identified for each of the separate aggregates, respectively. The indicators obtained through this procedure form the basis of the subsequent analysis. Table 6.1 summarises the results for the full data sample and across all countries available.24 As can be seen, the food and beverages, rubber and plastic as well as fabricated metals, electrical machinery and motor vehicles industries are identified to have a positive employment and productivity growth trend over the full data sample from 1963 to 2017. Table 6.1: Runner industries: all countries over the full sample period.

Conducting the runner industry analysis as done above one can learn more about the general trend and dynamics within manufacturing. On the other hand, this approach also has its limitations: First of all, it analyses productivity growth over a very long window of time. At the same time, it creates averages across many countries, some of which may only have data for some earlier or later periods. In this sense, this initial analysis measures for example the effect of colour TVs in the 1970s together with the digital revolution as well as industry 4.0 together in the more recent past together. This can be both instructive but also misleading as particularly developing countries have much better data coverage for the most recent decades. Consequently, if one would like to learn more about the runner industry trends in the more recent past, say, since 2000, a similar table can be obtained by simply truncating the data. The results are shown in Table 6.2 and show, that positive growth dynamics can now be reported for more manufacturing industries: Compared to before, now also the chemicals and precision instruments industries can be classified as runner industries. Please note that this difference of the patterns which are the result of changing the time dimension considered, are an important feature of the runner industry concept; see Appendix C. Table 6.2: Runner industries: all countries over the post-2000 sample period.

It is important to note that the results discussed so far are only reflective of the global average and hence show the pooled experience across a very broad and heterogeneous set of countries, both of the developing and developed world. Since we have already learnt about the very heterogeneous diffusion patterns of the new and digital technology in the previous sections, it is also highly instructive to conduct the same runner industry identification for a more narrowly defined group of countries, such as for the group of countries belonging to the same income group (the so called income group runners). Finally, we are of course also interested in the runner performance of or reference countries, Viet Nam and Morocco.25 We present a condensed summary of all classified runner industries across the different specifications in Table 6.3. This tables shows that there are a great number of runner industries for lower income countries in the post-2000s where positive employment and productivity growth has been achieved despite the most recent technological developments. Table 6.3 also shows that runner industries are typically identified to be on average part of the medium- and high-technology group which are characterised by their higher propensity to undergo R&amp;D endeavours (OECD 2011). We will discuss reasons why this should not be too big of a surprise in the next paragraph. However, it is important that this is not the result of some fixed classification (as that of technology groups for example), but purely the result of the growth dynamics of value added and employment: If an industry follows these favourable growth dynamics, then it will also qualify as a runner industry. This can be seen for the food end beverages industry which, despite being considered a low-technology industry, also belongs to the set of runner industries in most of the cases. The latter is an important insight regarding future development as well: It could be possible, that new technologies will allow an industry that is currently low-technology, to become more technologically sophisticated in the future. If this goes hand in hand with an expansion of the industry (through value added and employment growth), we will also be able to identify it as a runner industry. In this sense, the runner industry classification is capable of also this kind of dynamism which we refer to as intra-industry upgrading; see G for more information. Looking at Table 6.3 it also makes sense to link the results back to the earlier discussion on new digital technology and high technology industries: The first observation is that runner industries seem to be dominated by medium/high-technology industries: Following OECD (2011) the medium-/high-technology industries, chemicals, electrical machinery, precision instruments and motor vehicles very robustly appear across the different aggregates. What is more, the high-risk industries (Mayer 2018) which we have identified earlier as being electrical machinery, motor vehicles as well as chemicals and rubber and plastic also find their way into this representation. This overlap is both striking as it probably not too much of a surprise: The industries that extensively undertake R&amp;D are the ones that by and large are at the forefront of the current digital revolution in manufacturing. This might rightfully concern policy makers to ask to what degree jobs in these industries are at risk of being replaced by new and smart robots. At the same time these R&amp;D-intensive industries have also been leading in the previous automation efforts in the past. Was this at the expense of jobs? As our runner analysis illustrates, it is precisely these industries that can be characterised by a positive growth of productivity, value added and employment. In essence, it is this set of industries that have had a shaping effect on the fact of manufacturing: job destruction and job creation are central elements of the modernisation process of manufacturing industries. Lastly Table 6.3 also reveals that the runner profile for Viet Nam (as well as Morocco) is quite different to that of its lower middle income peers. At first sight it appears as if Viet Nam seems to report more runner industries for the low(er)-skilled manufacturing industries while the high(er)-skilled industries do not seem to qualify as runners. We will try to understand why that is in a the next step. Table 6.3: Summary of runner industries classification by aggregate Manufacturing Industries Global runners, full sample Global runners, post-200 Viet Nam runners Morocco runners Income group runners, full sample Income group runners, post-2000 15: Food and beverages x x x x x 18A: Wearing apparel x 21: Paper x 22: Printing and publishing x 24: Chemicals x x x x 25: Rubber and plastic x x x 26: Minerals 27: Basic metals x x 28: Fabricated metals x x x x x x 31A: Electrical machinery x x x x 29C: Machinery x 33: Precision instruments x X 34A: Motor vehicles x x x x x 36: Furniture, n.e.c x x x Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3. 6.1.2 Advanced manufacturing industry profiling It is important to note that the idea of runner industries is not a static concept. It fundamentally depends on the set of countries and time periods looked at. In other words, even though one industry follows a declining growth trend on the global average, this does not imply that this will have negative value added and employment growth dynamics for all countries and regions, respectively. In the same vein, the observation that another industry has shown inclusive and tenable growth characteristics on the global scale does not imply that this industry must be equally successful across all countries considered. In this regard it may not be a sensible strategy for a developing country to identify and/or advocate for the development of runner industries as identified either on the global stage or, more specifically, with regards to a sub-set of advanced economies. Having identified a successful runner industry in the aggregate does not imply that this industry will be equally successful across all countries. We have seen this point before when talking about the runner share exposure of Viet Nam (and Morocco) vis-a-vis other lower middle income countries. Consequently, for an analysis that is more focussed on the cross-sectional differences across countries and aggregates, it makes sense to summarise the growth rates of value added, employment as well as productivity in one big table similar to Table 6.4. Exemplarily, whereas the food and beverages industry has been following a declining growth trajectory it qualifies as a runner industry for Viet Nam. For the case of Morocco on the other hand, the food and beverage industry can be characterised by an employment-led growth trajectory. In other words, our analysis indicates that the Vietnamese and Moroccan food and beverage industries have followed a very different trend to that of the global average and/or that of its lower middle-income counterparts; they are also very different compared to each other.

Table 6.4 also allows us to investigate why the medium-/high-technology industries electrical machinery and precision instruments are identified as runner industries for Viet Nam while they are identified for the income group runners: There is no data available for these industries for the case of Viet Nam. While this is certainly encouraging it does not mean that we have to stop with the analysis there: Upon inspection of the Vietnamese raw data we learn that there is no index of industrial production data available, a variable the we require to calculate the real value added series; see Box ?.? for more information BOX ?.?: Recommendation on the use of IIP series in a situation of limited data coverage In some cases it is not possible to derive meaningful statistics on the basis of the available data because of the lack of data. For example, if either value added or employment data is missing for a particular industry in question, a runner industry analysis would not be feasible any more. In other cases Index of Industrial Production (IIP) necessary for the deflation of the nominal value added series is missing (see Appendix (???)(deflation) for more information) for a particular industry. In this case it is recommended to check if the IIP series for the whole manufacturing aggregate are available. If so, the manufacturing sector IIP series can be used to deflate the nominal value added series for a particular industry instead. It has to be noted that in this case it is assumed, that the inflation dynamics of the whole manufacturing sector are similar to that of the particular industry of interest. While this may not necessarily be the fully reflective of the actual industry level dynamics, it allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the industry dynamics within manufacturing which would have otherwise been impossible. In any case, analysts should always highlight it in their analysis if this ‘second best’ approach to deflating value added series is used. Until now we have identified a difference in the runner industries between the case of Viet Nam as well as Morocco and that of the aggregate of lower income countries. The next question we want to ask is how different the growth performance of Viet Nam is relative to that of all other lower income countries. This result is highlighted in Figure 6.1 which shows a simple histogram for the productivity, value added and employment CAGRs: This visual tool is helpful in illustrating how different the growth rates across the set of countries considered for the analysis is. Figure 6.1: CAGR distribution food and beverages. The red vertical lines identify the average growth rates for each of the three variables. Additionally, the three CAGRs for Viet Nam are highlighted in dark blue while the three CAGRs for Morocco are identified by the orange bars. This illustration serves two main purposes: First of all, it allows one to examine if the average growth rates are driven by some extreme (either very high or very low) growth rate or if they are representative of sector dynamics.26 In the case presented here we see that the histogram seems to be somewhat positively skewed. This means that the right tail of the distribution (the right side of the histogram) is longer (has more higher values) than the left.27 In other words, there are a few countries reporting considerably higher growth rates for productivity, value added and employment. At the same time, the highest number of countries report productivity (value added) growth rates of roughly +2 (+1) percent and -0.5 percent for employment as illustrated by the peak of the histogram count. Secondly, by comparing the histogram and average with the recorded growth rates for Viet Nam (dark blue bar in Figure 6.1), one can easily and quickly compare Viet Nam’s growth performance relative to that of other countries: Whereas Viet Nam’s productivity growth rate appears to be in line with that of the majority of economies compared here, its value added and employment growth rates belong to the highest in the sample. This result again illustrates the importance of considering the productivity dynamics alongside that of its composing factors as a similar productivity growth rate could have also been achieved by a lower value added and potentially negative employment growth rate as the case of the lower middle income countries in Table 6.4 has illustrated. As for Morocco, Figure 6.1) illustrates that the Moroccan food and beverage industry has a value added growth rate close to that of the average while it also has one of the highest employment growth rates of all lower middle income countries. These two observations help understand why labour productivity for Morocco is amongst the lowest of all lower middle income countries considered. 6.1.3 Runner industry exposure In the previous step we discussed ways to measure the performance of manufacturing industries along the delineating lines of productivity, value added and employment. We saw how this kind of analysis is sensible to the choice of country comparators and time dimensions. It also highlighted the importance of assessing an industry performance in the context of the variation across countries. While this may serve as an important step to learn about the dynamics of a particular (set of) industry(ies) of a country, it says very little about the characteristics of the manufacturing industry of a particular country as a whole. Consequently, and in order to assess the degree to which a country’s manufacturing sector is comprised of industries with a certain set of characteristics (like the ones described by the characterisation of runner industries), a simple ratio of runner industries in total manufacturing is proposed. To this end we refer to the global-/income group-/country runner exposure when evaluating the share of industries that have been identified as runners on the global/income group-/country-level relative to the share of all manufacturing industries, respectively. In this way we can obtain two simple indicators that allow us to assess the share of manufacturing industries in an economy that have experienced inclusive and sustained growth in the past. If, for example, the share of runner industries in total manufacturing of a country is very low, this may indicate higher risk of jobless growth in the wake of technological adoptions which would deserve attention from the policy makers especially in terms of measures for employment protection. We have also seen in previous sections that in the long term a higher and prolonged exposure towards sectors which on average are not the best performers in terms of jobs creation may be associated with lower income levels. What is more, the concept of runner exposure may be useful not only in order to summarize the performance of one particular country, it can also be used to produce country rankings based on either the runner share in total manufacturing value added or employment, respectively. We illustrate this in Table 6.5 which ranks the list of lower middle income countries with regards to their exposure to their post-2000 runner industries. The obtained percentages presented in this table are that of the year 2015. What becomes apparent is that out of the evaluated 11 lower middle income countries, Moroccan and Viet Nam rank pretty much in the middle as far as the runner value added share is concerned. As for employment, Morocco beats Viet Nam by about 10 percentage points. It is interesting to note that there Morocco belongs to the top-4 with a share of 25 percent, wile Viet Nam shares the third-to-last place of runner employment share exposure with Kyrgyzstan at 15 percent. It is particularly this observation that merits further discussion: This is because so far we have benchmarked Viet Nam against a group of countries that share the same income group. This, however, does not necessarily imply that they also automatically follow the same industrial strategy and/or industry composition. We have seen this point before with Table 6.4 as well as Figure 6.1). Table 6.5: Exposure to income group runner industry ranking, year 2016, post-2000 runners, sorted by runner value added and employment share in descending order. Rank (of 11) Country Runner value added share Runner employment share 1 Philippines 0.46 0.31 2 Egypt 0.40 0.21 3 Indonesia 0.37 0.20 4 India 0.35 0.30 5 Morocco 0.33 0.25 6 Viet Nam 0.27 0.15 7 Ukraine 0.23 0.31 8 Sri Lanka 0.13 0.08 9 Republic of Moldova 0.09 0.12 10 Mongolia 0.08 0.12 11 Kyrgyzstan 0.02 0.15 Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2000-2017, runner exposure shares shown for year 2015. Ranking based on a total of 57 included cases. As a last building block we calculate the runner exposure on the basis of the country-level runner industries for Viet Nam and Morocco which we have seen before in Table 6.3. We present the results Table ?? and can see a considerable difference between the country-level runner exposure analysis and its global counterpart in Table ??: For example, the runner value added share increases from 33% to 88% and an even higher increase (from 25% to 89%) can be observed for the runner employment share for Viet Nam. Are these very different results contradictory? By no means! Rather, they allow us to identify a set of very importance insights with regards to the Vietnamese manufacturing sector: Because Viet Nam has no data for a medium-/high-technology industry that is also classified as a global runner (electrical machinery) it is clear, why the global runner exposure share for Viet Nam seems particularly low. This is however only one part of the story. Another building block is the fact that the industries that do qualify as runner industries for Viet Nam make up a the majority of the manufacturing sector. This can be seen as a great strength of Viet Nam’s manufacturing sector as around 90% of its manufacturing sector consists of industries that are displaying positive productivity and employment growth rates. At the same time we can also identify a potential thread: We have seen that Viet Nam’s manufacturing sector is somewhat skewed towards the lower-technology industries. This is in relation to the global pattern as well as the pattern of the other lower income countries. Considered together, this information provides valuable insights for Vietnamese policy makers as it points out the uniqueness of its manufacturing sector with its currently pronounced emphasis on the lower skill end of the manufacturing process. On the other hand Morocco’s difference between the income group runner exposure and the country-level runner exposure is notably smaller. This is interesting for two reasons: Morocco’s runner industry profile has more weight on medium- high-technology industries compared to Viet Nam as chemicals, machinery and precision instruments are part of Morocco’s runner industries but not Viet Nam’s. Secondly, despite the fact that Morocco identifies 8 industries (compared to 7 for the case of Viet Nam) as runners, the corresponding runner industry shares for value added and employment is 16 to 26 percentage points lower than that of Viet Nam. This means that the share of industries with favourable productivity and employment trajectories are a much smaller part of the Moroccan manufacturing sector when compared to Viet Nam. Table 6.6: Exposure to runner industry for Viet Nam in year 2016, post-2000 runners, sorted by runner value added and employment share in descending order. Country Runner value added share Runner employment share Morocco 0.62 0.73 Viet Nam 0.88 0.89 Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2000-2017, runner exposure shares shown for year 2016. SUMMARY To conclude, in this section we have applied the concept of runner industries to identify growth dynamics. We follow the example of the Vietnamese manufacturing industries and related them to more general dynamics observed amongst the set of lower middle-income countries. The analysis has further highlighted the fact that the concept of runner industries is relative and therefore sensitive to the choice of data sample. Whereas this certainly makes the concept of runner industries a challenging instrument to apply, it also constitutes its biggest advantage over more static classifications: Following the notion that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to manufacturing policy in general and technology adoption in particular, the runner industries framework allows for a flexible identification of growth enhancing (in the context of value added and employment creation) identification and classification of industries which can be tailored and streamlined to follow the particular assessment needs of policy makers. At the same time, the runner instrument has also highlighted that even within a narrowly defined window of analysis, differences in the respective growth rates are reflective of country-specific effects and should therefore be given close consideration during the interpretation stage of the runner industry assessment. For a careful consideration of the runner industry classification in the case of Viet Nam it is important to contextualize the differences identified vis-à-vis the group of lower-middle income countries as well as the world trend. By and large Viet Nam can be characterized by reporting a disproportionally high contribution of employment-led industries (where positive employment growth out-paces value added growth thereby leading to a negative productivity growth rate). Vietnamese policy makers should be aware of these dynamics as they may bring about important ramifications particularly in the context of the adoption of new technologies. References "],

However, please note that the statement ‘The results of the runner analysis depend on the time dimension’ is not a true statement. The results of these analysis do not necessarily depend on the time window but on how the variables of interest have changed that period. For this consider the visualisation presented in Figure @(fig:fig8a): The black line depicts the stylised movement of productivity (y-axis) over time (x-axis). We also see that this line is hump-shaped. Because of this property, we will find different results when evaluating this industry depending on the time span we use for the runner industry analysis: Moderate positive growth for the period associated with the red line; High positive growth for the period associated with the yellow line; Negative growth for the period associated with the green line. Figure B.1: Does visualising the concept make sense here? It is obviously, that if productivity had followed a straight line (the slope is irrelevant for this) one would have found the same dynamics for this industry irrespective of the time frame considered.

["rujust.html", "C Justification of runner exposure analysis", " C Justification of runner exposure analysis The identification of runner industries offers a new way to highlight favourable industry-related performance patterns. Given the characteristics of a runner industry, i.e. a positive productivity, value added and employment growth rate, a high share of runner industries in total manufacturing of a country implies that, on average, a country’s manufacturing sector displays favourable productivity growth dynamics while also upholding employment growth; both of which are highly desirable outcomes. The idea of having a high share of runner industries in total manufacturing of the economy therefore stands to reason as it imposes an interesting enigma: The higher the share of industries that have grown over time, the higher your economic output. Yet, it is not opposed to the often times pursued goal of having a high share of medium-high technology industries forming the backbone of a sustainably developing manufacturing sector. This is because of the following two reasons: First of all, the overlap between the concept of medium-high technology industries and that of runners is substantial: the majority of identified runner industries belong to the group of medium-high technology industries; see ??. For the post-2000 sample, this increases to six out of seven industries. In this sense, the overlap created through the empirical identification of runner industries can be understood as a confirmation of the positive effect of technological advancements in manufacturing that can also be employment enhancing. Secondly, the concept of runner industries adds an additional layer of dynamism to the process as it enables one to capture within-industry structural change dynamics. Because of its dynamic nature, the concept of runner industries offers a gateway to an organic identification of newly emerging trends in manufacturing development: It allows for the possibility to capture the productivity and employment dynamics of an industry which may in fact transition from a low to medium-high technology configuration as a consequence of its adoption of new technology. This transition may then be accompanied by an increase in both productivity as well as employment demanding a particular and novel skill set. Whereas such dynamics can be unveiled using the concept of runner industries, it would remain hidden with the fixed classification of technology groups. Nonetheless, it goes without saying that the concept of runner industries should not be seen as a competing but rather a complementing measure when it comes to identifying favourable manufacturing sector compositions and should not replace the existing technology-centred paradigm. If, for example, the share of runner industries in total manufacturing of a country is very low, this may indicate higher risk of jobless growth in the wake of technological adoptions which would deserve attention from the policy makers especially in terms of measures for employment protection. We have also seen in previous sections that in the long term a higher and prolonged exposure towards sectors which on average are not the best performers in terms of jobs creation may be associated with lower income levels. What is more, the concept of runner exposure may be useful not only in order to summarize the performance of one particular country, it can also be used to produce country rankings based on either the runner share in total manufacturing value added or employment, respectively. We illustrate this in Table C.1 which ranks the countries with regards to their exposure to post-2000 runner industries for the year 2016 by runner value added and employment share in descending order. What becomes apparent is that out of the top-10 countries eight belong to the group of high-income countries while Viet Nam ranks 42nd out of 57 in terms of value added runner shares. In other words, 54 percent of value added contribution (33 percent of employment contribution) to total manufacturing value added (employment) in 2016 has come from industries that have reported positive value added and employment growth rates in the post-2000 period. This puts Viet Nam into the 18 percentile of ranked countries in terms of value added generation (2nd percentile for employment).28 Table C.1 is only a snapshot in time and illustrates that there seems to be somewhat of a separating pull between high income and lower middle (as well as lower income countries which are not shown in this table) in terms of their runner exposure. This is, however, only for 2016. Consequently, it would be interesting to se, if the wedge between advanced and developing countries also exists when we look at a longer time window. The relationship between a high share of runner industries and economic performance can also be summarized visually: In Figure C.1, the shaded areas illustrate the share of runner industries in manufacturing value added for different percentiles of the data: In the darkest shade of grey, the minimum to 20th percentile of value added runner share contributions is visualized over time followed by the 20th to 40th percentile in a lighter shade of grey etc. The upper edge of the lightest grey is representing the country which has reported the highest share of runners in value added between the years 1990 to 2017. What is more, the coloured lines identify the average runner share for the set of developed, i.e. high income, and developing (all but high income) countries. In other words, for the average developed economy (which is obtained by calculating the average runner industry exposure across all high income countries), the value added share of runner industries in manufacturing has increased from around 40 percent in 1999 to around 50 percent in 2016. Contrary to this, the corresponding share for the group of developing countries has remained stable at around the 40 percent mark. Table C.1: Exposure to runner industry ranking, year 2016, post-2000 runners, sorted by runner value added and employment share in descending order. Rank (of 57) Country Runner value added share Runner employment share Income group 1 Switzerland 0.89 0.82 High income 2 Luxembourg 0.87 0.90 High income 4 Germany 0.80 0.79 High income 6 France 0.79 0.79 High income 7 Philippines 0.78 0.66 Lower middle income 8 Hungary 0.77 0.74 High income 9 Netherlands 0.76 0.77 High income 12 Colombia 0.74 0.63 Upper middle income 13 Croatia 0.74 0.65 High income 20 Egypt 0.69 0.53 Lower middle income 21 Indonesia 0.69 0.48 Lower middle income 32 Ukraine 0.64 0.62 Lower middle income 35 Bulgaria 0.62 0.57 Upper middle income 40 Republic of Moldova 0.58 0.57 Lower middle income 42 Viet Nam 0.54 0.33 Lower middle income 44 Mongolia 0.51 0.42 Lower middle income 46 Sri Lanka 0.50 0.36 Lower middle income 47 India 0.47 0.50 Lower middle income 57 Kyrgyzstan 0.17 0.50 Lower middle income Note: INDSTAT 2 rev.3, 2000-2017, runner exposure shares shown for year 2016. Ranking based on a total of 57 included cases. Similarly, considering the most recent two decades characterized by a fast-paced adoption of new technologies, the set of runner industries identified for the post-2000 period in Figure C.2 display the same characteristics as that for the previously highlighted full sample: The average runner share of developed economies remains somewhat 10 percent higher compared to that of developing countries. This is particularly insightful as the set of runner industries identified for the post-2000 sample has been complemented by an additional high technology (chemicals) as well as one low technology (food and beverages) industry. Figure C.1: Visualisation of concept. As such, Figure C.1 and Figure C.2 are generalisations of the country- and income-group specific dynamics that are discussed in Table C.1. Figure C.2: Visualisation of concept. As shares of runners can be underestimated for developing countries because IIPs for some sectors in some countries may drop some available value added data especially for this group of countries, we repeat as a robustness exercise the same graphs by using nominal values. Despite the cost of fixing the IIPs lack of data issue is to use a dataset which does not correct inflation, results prove to be qualitatively similar and reinforce the robustness of the empirical regularity. Percentiles calculated in terms of rankings: \\(1- 41/57 \\approx 26\\%\\) and \\(1- 56/57 \\approx 2\\%\\) for value added and employment, respectively.↩ "],

["deflation.html", "E Deflation of nominal value added series", " E Deflation of nominal value added series Deflation, i.e. eliminating the effect of inflation, of the value added series is a necessary intermediate step as high growth rates of nominal value added might be the consequence of strong price increases (inflation). Consequently, nominal value added growth rates might wrongfully indicate an increase in productivity even though the effect is actually only driven by the variation in prices over time. Consequently, these price effects have to be eliminated from the nominal value added series. This is done by deflating the nominal value added sequences in order to obtain their real value added representation. For the purpose of this analysis we construct real value added sequences based on the methodology proposed in Haraguchi and Amann (2019) which is calculated as \\[ rVA_{ist} = nVA_{ist} \\times Deflator_{ist} \\] \\[ Deflator_{ist} = \\frac{nGO_{bst}}{nGO_{ist}} \\times IIP_{ist} \\] where \\(nVA\\), \\(rVA\\) denotes nominal and real value added in period \\(t\\), sector \\(s\\) and country \\(i\\), respectively. The \\(Deflator\\) is given by the ratio of nominal gross output (\\(nGO\\)) in the base year \\(b\\) relative to nominal gross output in period \\(t\\) and its corresponding Industrial Index of Production (IIP). The benefit of calculating real value added in this form is that it allows for the creation of an industry-specific deflator across countries, thereby facilitating the construction of comparative measures which is particularly important for a cross-country comparator analysis.

["progressionpatterns.html", "I Progression patterns in import and export dynamics", " I Progression patterns in import and export dynamics While Figures I.2 and I.1 provide some interesting insights on the evolution of classification patterns of the different income groups over time, one can furthermore derive some clear empirical evidence in favour of a technological progression that is reflected in changes of the import/export structure of capital and industry 4.0 goods as economies growth richer. In this section we will take a closer look at the underlying fundamentals. Remember that in in the section on technology adoption we have introduced a classification of the following sort: RCA import RCA export Group &lt; 1 &gt; 1 Specialized producer &gt; 1 &gt; 1 Specialized producer and user &gt; 1 &lt; 1 Specialized user &lt; 1 &lt; 1 Non specialized As it turns out, we can identify a strong regularity when comparing the classification patterns of capital goods vs. industry 4.0 goods: In 90 percent of recorded cases in our data, countries are in a ‘higher’ (more specialised) or the same group for capital goods than for industry 4.0 goods. In other words, they are ‘leading in capital goods but following in industry 4.0 goods’ in the sense that they have a higher proclivity to export capital goods before they export industry 4.0 goods. Table I.1 provides a more detailed account of that observation.29 There, for example, in 82 percent of cases a non specialised country in capital goods is also found to be non specialised in industry 4.0 goods. On the other hand, at least a third of specialized producers in capital goods are also specialized producers in industry 4.0 goods.

The above tables might be too much? Figures I.2 and I.1 displayed average RCAs by income group. Averages were calculated for all years and per income group. A more detailed way to display these patterns is the following: Figure I.1: Classification of countries by year and income group On average, low income countries are non-specialized in capital goods, neither importing nor exporting above average. Around 40% of them are specialized users, meaning they import and use some capital goods, starting the adoption process. On average, lower middle income countries have higher shares of specialized users than low income countries and five to ten percent of them are also exporting capital goods above world average. On average, higher middle income countries have a higher share of specialized users and producers compared to lower middle income countries and they already have some specialized producers. On average, high income countries have the highest share of specialized producers and the lowest share of specialized users. The same can be done for 4.0 goods and results in the following figure: Figure I.2: Classification of countries by year and income group Only high income countries are above average exporters of goods related to the newest wave of production technology. Additionally, the higher the income, the higher the share of countries that are specialized users, i.e. above average importers of modern production technology. When we compare countries across groups of goods (capital goods vs. 4.0 goods), we find a very consistent pattern: the majority of countries (about 90%) are specialized producers and users in capital goods before they are in industry 4.0 goods. There are only a handful exceptions where a country would be classified as a specialized producer of the newest technology but not for capital goods. This should convince policy makers that a solid manufacturing basis that uses different vintages of technologies is a prerequisite for being a specialised producer in the most modern technologies. This pattern holds for virtually all low income countries as well as lower and upper-middle income countries in our sample. The only exceptions from this rule are some high-income countries that specialise in new 4.0 technology and are not main exporters of capital goods. They, however, most likely built a solid manufacturing basis in prior decades. Please note that in Table I.1 the analysis is conducted ‘by capital goods group’, i.e. the rows sum up to 100 percent which is why the measure of 90 percent cannot be recovered from the presented table.↩ "],
