In the blog post [*The socioeconomic impact of circularity in developing countries*](https://iap.unido.org/articles/socioeconomic-impact-circularity-developing-countries), we introduce a novel tool, built on granular firm-level data and Input-Output modelling, to assess the economic, social and environmental impact of Circular Economy (CE):

The circular economy is critical to ensuring green and just socioeconomic outcomes through decoupling economic growth from increased resource use. In a [recent report](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/sustainability-transition-in-europe), the European Environmental Agency discusses that the transition to the green and circular economy (CE) is driven by multiple environmental, demographic, technological, fiscal and financial transitions occurring in different sectors and geographies. CE may play a pivotal role in this transition because of its potential “triple positive impact” on economic growth as well as environmental and societal outcomes.
