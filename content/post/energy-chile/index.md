In the blog post [*The effects of energy prices on firm competitiveness in Chile*](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/effects-energy-prices-firm-competitiveness-chile), we analyse the effect of energy price increases on firm-level productivity in Chile:

Firms are key to addressing Chile’s sustainability challenges and realizing its ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. Switching to more sustainable production is essential to reducing vulnerability to environmental shocks and developing new areas of comparative advantage. In a [recent working paper](http://hdl.handle.net/10986/39808), we illustrate minimal trade-offs between productivity and energy prices, and a positive relationship between productivity and investments with fossil fuel prices.
