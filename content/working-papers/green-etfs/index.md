abstract:  Adequately identifying relevant heterogeneity in the impact of economic policy is crucial for effective policy design, though notoriously challenging for policymakers and researchers. In this paper, we demonstrate how we can measure the heterogeneity in monetary policy impacts across standard macroeconomic variables such as investment, with the creative use of the *synthetic difference-in-differences* (SDID) estimation techniques. Using higher frequency financial data from exchange-traded fund assets, we find stark differences in terms of impact on green vs wider macroeconomic investment. In a period of monetary tightening, the cumulative returns on green investment vis-a-vis wider investment instruments drop back sharply, suggesting the need for mitigating measures to protect the sector from undue economic damage during times of financial stress.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

## **Abstract**
In this paper we revisit the busy debate over the relationship between volatility and growth, to separate out the effects on growth that come from short run and long run episodes of uncertainty. Employing this time series perspective, we reconcile the theoretical ambiguities and explain the conflicting differences in empirical studies of this important linkage. We suggest that the relationship depends on the type of volatility responsible for driving economic fluctuations; volatility that reflects longer run positive characteristics is positively associated with economic growth, with shorter spells of uncertainty associated with poorer macroeconomic outcomes. Stabilisation policy needs to discriminate between good volatility and bad volatility.
