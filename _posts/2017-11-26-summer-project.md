Over the summer I was involved in an interesting project by the
<a href="http://www.antislaverycommissioner.co.uk" target="_blank">Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner</a>
who partnered with the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Nottingham</a> 
to launched research looking into modern slavery and, more particularly, anti-slavery partnerships in the UK.

The idea behind this project was to identify and evaluate anti-slavery partnerships which have formed across 
the UK in their efforts to address the crime of slavery. It was my job to carry out the statistical analysis 
and collaborate in the spatial \wmapping of this project.

You can find out more about the project on 
<a href="http://www.antislaverycommissioner.co.uk/news-insights/new-research-collaborating-for-freedom-anti-slavery-partnerships-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">this website</a> 
where you can also download the final report. Don't miss out on taking a look at  
<a href="http://iascmap.nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank">this website</a> 
where can learn more about local authorities and agencies across the country and their efforts to fight modern slavery on British soil.
