*Growth in a time of austerity: evidence from the UK* (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjpe.12132/abstract" target="_blank">link to paper</a>) is a co-authored piece with my former MSc thesis supervisor at Manchester, <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/paul.middleditch.html" target="_blank">Paul Middleditch</a>.

Paul has  <a href="http://blog.policy.manchester.ac.uk/posts/2017/01/austerity-and-the-mere-problem-of-causality/" target="_blank">blogged</a> about the problem of austerity and causality on the <a href="http://blog.policy.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Manchester Policy Blogs</a> which provides a very interesting and less technical introduction to the arguments made in our joint paper.
