I've put together a quick [Covid-19 dashboard](https://amannj.shinyapps.io/COVID-19_Dashboard/) where I've tried to bring in some of the features I've been missing in some of the other versions that are out there (e.g. dynamic country selection, interactive figure scaling and selection and data transformation).

The dashboard also incorporates some more granular information on my home country Austria.

Hope you like it - [thoughts and comments](https://github.com/amannj/COVID-19/issues) are highly appreciated!
